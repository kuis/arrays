# Arrays

## Server & Front-end Code Repository

### Repository Contents:

1. Front-end web server application at [`local_modules/app`](local_modules/app), including front-end publicly hosted assets at [`local_modules/app/public`](local_modules/app/public)

2. Database seeding for MVP via CSV import at [`local_modules/data_ingestion`](local_modules/data_ingestion)

3. Raw import MongoDB modeling at [`local_modules/raw_objects`](local_modules/raw_objects) 


---------------------

### Getting Started

#### i. Setting up your local development environment

1. Install brew

	* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)

2. Install Node.JS & NPM: 
	* [Install Node.js and npm using Homebrew on OS X](https://changelog.com/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x/), 
	* [How to Install Node.js and NPM on a Mac](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)

3. Install MongoDB: 
	* [Install MongoDB Community Edition on OS X](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
	
    Note: If you already have Mongo installed, be sure you have >= v3.2 with `brew update && brew upgrade mongodb`
    
4. Run the MongoDB daemon by executing `monogod` in a Terminal window

#### ii. Installing the Arrays server locally

##### I. Download repo

1. First, clone this repository to your computer with `git clone git@github.com:schemadesign/arrays.git`

##### II. Getting onto the 'develop' branch

1. Change directory (`cd [the path to]/arrays`) into your local clone of this repository
2. Execute `git checkout develop`

##### III. Installing `node_modules` in the 'develop' package.json

1. Change directory (`cd [the path to]/arrays`) into your local clone of this repository
2. Execute `npm install`


###### IV. (Not necessary as of this edit) Installing git submodules

1. Change directory (`cd [the path to]/arrays`) into your local clone of this repository
2. Execute `git submodule init` and then `git submodule update`.
3. (Optional) Recursively checkout 'develop' on nested submodules.


#### iii. Seeding the local database with MVP CSV content

1. Change directory (`cd [the path to]/arrays`) into your local clone of this repository
2. Execute [`bin/_dev_MVP_DB_seed`](bin/_dev_MVP_DB_seed)


#### iv. Running the front-end web server locally

1. Change directory (`cd [the path to]/arrays`) into your local clone of this repository
2. Execute [`bin/start_dev_app`](bin/start_dev_app)

### Customizing the database-seeding import

See this Doc for information on the data import framework capabilities.

---------------------

### Contributing
1. Contributors should check out the 'develop' branch with `git checkout develop` and push only non-breaking changes to this branch. 

2. Commits that might include breaking changes, i.e. API modifications, large refactors, cross-module works-inâ€“progress, etc., should go on a separate branch. To create a new branch, execute `git checkout -b [your branch name]`. 

3. When you're ready to merge your branch back into 'develop':

	3a. `git pull` to get the latest changes to 'develop' from origin,

	3b. checkout your branch, 
	
	3c. execute `git rebase -i develop`, 
	
	3d. resolve any conflicts during the interactive rebase, 
	
	3e. checkout 'develop',
	
	3f. finally, execute `git merge [your branch name]`. 

	If everything went well it's also a good idea to prune your old branches, especially if you have pushed them up to origin (github). (Note: This same interactive-rebase-and-merge procedure is applied when merging 'develop' into 'master' for a release. The rebase is included in case hotfixes are added to 
	'master' which need to be backwards-integrated into 'develop' - which should be avoided whenever possible.) 

4. Production releases should generally be tagged on 'master', and this should probably be automated later by using a continuous integration system.

### Deploying to production 

#### Deploying HEAD to Google Cloud Platform/App Engine

1. Execute [`bin/deploy`](bin/deploy)

#### Seeding the production database

1. Execute [`bin/_PRODUCTION__MVP_DB_seed`](bin/_PRODUCTION__MVP_DB_seed)
