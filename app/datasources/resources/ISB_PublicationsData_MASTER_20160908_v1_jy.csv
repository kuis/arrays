The causative gene for NF1 encodes a multi-domain protein, neurofibromin, which interacts with RAS through its RAS-GAP domain. Dysfunction of neurofibromin results in abnormal RAS activation in the cells which has been thought to be the main process in the initiation and progression of NF1. Based on this hypothesis, inhibitors for various RAS mediated signaling pathways are in different stages of clinical trials to treat NF1 or NF1-associated symptoms. While the molecular genetics of NF1 has made significant progress in recent years, the underlying etiology and progression of NF1 are yet to be fully understood. Besides review and summarization of the latest results of genetic, transcriptomic and microRNA studies associated with NF1, we conducted limited post-hoc analysis to illustrate the importance of using integrated systems biology approach to study complex diseases like NF1.",2012-06,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,464-8,,2,235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Gene Regulatory Networks/*physiology; Humans; MicroRNAs/*physiology; Neurofibromatosis 1/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology; Signal Transduction/genetics; Systems Biology/*methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these transcriptomic profiles showed three clusters that correspond to three ecologically important behavioral categories: aggression, maturation, and foraging. To explore the genetic influences potentially regulating these behavior-specific neurogenomic states, we reconstructed a brain transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) model. This brain TRN quantitatively predicts with high accuracy gene expression changes of more than 2,000 genes involved in behavior, even for behavioral phenotypes on which it was not trained, suggesting that there is a core set of TFs that regulates behavior-specific gene expression in the bee brain, and other TFs more specific to particular categories. TFs playing key roles in the TRN include well-known regulators of neural and behavioral plasticity, e.g., Creb, as well as TFs better known in other biological contexts, e.g., NF-kappaB (immunity). Our results reveal three insights concerning the relationship between genes and behavior. First, distinct behaviors are subserved by distinct neurogenomic states in the brain. Second, the neurogenomic states underlying different behaviors rely upon both shared and distinct transcriptional modules. Third, despite the complexity of the brain, simple linear relationships between TFs and their putative target genes are a surprisingly prominent feature of the networks underlying behavior.",11/1/11,2/8/16 23:45,2/9/16 0:19,,18020-18025,,44,108,,"PNAS, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences",,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,"*Behavior; *Genomics; *Transcription, Genetic; Animals; Bees/physiology; Brain/metabolism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glial cells also show extensive alpha-synuclein pathology and may contribute to disease progression. However, the mechanism that produces the glial alpha-synuclein pathology and the interaction between neurons and glia in the disease-inflicted microenvironment remain unknown. Here, we show that alpha-synuclein proteins released from neuronal cells are taken up by astrocytes through endocytosis and form inclusion bodies. The glial accumulation of alpha-synuclein through the transmission of the neuronal protein was also demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model expressing human alpha-synuclein. Furthermore, astrocytes that were exposed to neuronal alpha-synuclein underwent changes in the gene expression profile reflecting an inflammatory response. Induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines correlated with the extent of glial accumulation of alpha-synuclein. Together, these results suggest that astroglial alpha-synuclein pathology is produced by direct transmission of neuronal alpha-synuclein aggregates, causing inflammatory responses. This transmission step is thus an important mediator of pathogenic glial responses and could qualify as a new therapeutic target.",3/19/10,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,9262-72,,12,285,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,alpha-Synuclein/*metabolism; Animals; Astrocytes/*metabolism; Biological; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Conditioned/pharmacology; Culture Media; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Mice; Models; Neurodegenerative Diseases/metabolism; Neurons/*metabolism; Rats; Sprague-Dawley; Transgenic; Tumor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The neurovirulence of these viruses has long been known to be determined by the sequence of the viral envelope protein, although the nature of the neurotoxicity remains to be clarified. Studies on the neurovirulent viruses FrCas(NC) and Moloney murine leukemia virus ts1 indicate that the nascent envelope protein misfolds, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and induces an unfolded protein response. In the present study we constructed a series of viruses with chimeric envelope genes containing segments from virulent and avirulent retroviruses. Each of the viruses studied was highly neuroinvasive but differed in the severity of the neurological disease they induced. Only viruses that contained the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the neurovirulent virus induced neurological disease. Likewise, only viruses containing the RBD of the neurovirulent virus exhibited increased binding of the ER chaperone BiP to the envelope precursor protein and induced the unfolded protein response. Thus, the RBD determined both neurovirulence and folding instability. Among viruses carrying the neurovirulent RBD, the severity of the disease was increased when envelope sequences from the neurovirulent virus outside the RBD were also present. Interestingly, these sequences appeared to further increase the degree of folding instability (BiP binding) of the viral envelope protein. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that this spongiform neurodegenerative disease represents a virus-induced protein folding disorder.",2009-06,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,6079-86,,12,83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Protein Folding; Animals; Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism; Inbred Strains; Mice; Neurodegenerative Diseases/*virology; NIH 3T3 Cells; Retroviridae/genetics/*pathogenicity; Retroviridae Infections/*virology; RNA; Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Viral/metabolism; Virulence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E.",Genome-wide identification of calcium-response factor (CaRF) binding sites predicts a role in regulation of neuronal signaling pathways,PLOS One,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010870,,"Calcium-Response Factor (CaRF) was first identified as a transcription factor based on its affinity for a neuronal-selective calcium-response element (CaRE1) in the gene encoding Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). However, because CaRF shares no homology with other transcription factors, its properties and gene targets have remained unknown. Here we show that the DNA binding domain of CaRF has been highly conserved across evolution and that CaRF binds DNA directly in a sequence-specific manner in the absence of other eukaryotic cofactors. Using a binding site selection screen we identify a high-affinity consensus CaRF response element (cCaRE) that shares significant homology with the CaRE1 element of Bdnf. In a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP-Seq), we identified 176 sites of CaRF-specific binding (peaks) in neuronal genomic DNA. 128 of these peaks are within 10kB of an annotated gene, and 60 are within 1kB of an annotated transcriptional start site. At least 138 of the CaRF peaks contain a common 10-bp motif with strong statistical similarity to the cCaRE, and we provide evidence predicting that CaRF can bind independently to at least 64.5% of these motifs in vitro. Analysis of this set of putative CaRF targets suggests the enrichment of genes that regulate intracellular signaling cascades. Finally we demonstrate that expression of a subset of these target genes is altered in the cortex of Carf knockout (KO) mice. Together these data strongly support the characterization of CaRF as a unique transcription factor and provide the first insight into the program of CaRF-regulated transcription in neurons.",2010,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e10870,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Signal Transduction; Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Consensus Sequence/genetics; Conserved Sequence/genetics; DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism; Evolution; Genetic; Genome/*genetics; Knockout; Mice; Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Neurons/*metabolism; Protein Binding; Transcription; Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism; Transcription Initiation Site,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It follows that disease (a network shift that causes malfunction) is also an emergent property, emerging from a perturbation of the network. On the one hand, the biomolecular network of every individual is unique and this is evident when similar disease-producing agents cause different individual pathologies. Consequently, a personalized model and approach for every patient may be required for therapies to become effective across mankind. On the other hand, diverse combinations of internal and external perturbation factors may cause a similar shift in network functioning. We offer this as an explanation for the multi-factorial nature of most diseases: they are ""systems biology diseases,"" or ""network diseases."" Here we use neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's disease (PD), as an example to show that due to the inherent complexity of these networks, it is difficult to understand multi-factorial diseases with simply our ""naked brain."" When describing interactions between biomolecules through mathematical equations and integrating those equations into a mathematical model, we try to reconstruct the emergent properties of the system in silico. The reconstruction of emergence from interactions between huge numbers of macromolecules is one of the aims of systems biology. Systems biology approaches enable us to break through the limitation of the human brain to perceive the extraordinarily large number of interactions, but this also means that we delegate the understanding of reality to the computer. We no longer recognize all those essences in the system's design crucial for important physiological behavior (the so-called ""design principles"" of the system). In this paper we review evidence that by using more abstract approaches and by experimenting in silico, one may still be able to discover and understand the design principles that govern behavioral emergence.",2012,2/8/16 23:58,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,3,,Front Physiol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aerobic glycolysis, a common metabolic pattern in cancers cells, was recently discovered in both the healthy and diseased human brain, but its functional significance is not understood. This metabolic pattern in the brain is surprising because it results in decreased efficiency of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in a tissue with high energetic demands. We report that highly aggressive honey bees (Apis mellifera) show a brain transcriptomic and metabolic state consistent with aerobic glycolysis, i.e. increased glycolysis in combination with decreased oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, exposure to alarm pheromone, which provokes aggression, causes a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis in the bee brain. We hypothesize that this metabolic state, which is associated with altered neurotransmitter levels, increased glycolytically derived ATP and a reduced cellular redox state, may lead to increased neuronal excitability and oxidative stress in the brain. Our analysis provides evidence for a robust, distinct and persistent brain metabolic response to aggression-inducing social cues. This finding for the first time associates aerobic glycolysis with naturally occurring behavioral plasticity, which has important implications for understanding both healthy and diseased brain function.",1/30/15,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,158-166,,2,14,,Genes Brain Behav,,,,,,,,eng,(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spatial expression profiles of astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-specific genes also revealed regional differences; these defined fewer regions and were less distinct but still symmetrical in the coronal plane.

Our goal was to provide mechanistic insights as to how neurosecretory signals mediate division of labor in the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Worker division of labor is based on a process of behavioral maturation by individual bees, which involves performing in-hive tasks early in adulthood, then transitioning to foraging for food outside the hive. Social and nutritional cues converge on endocrine factors to regulate behavioral maturation, but whether neurosecretory systems are central to this process is not known. To explore this, we performed transcriptomic profiling of a neurosecretory region of the brain, the pars intercerebralis (PI). We first compared PI transcriptional profiles for bees performing in-hive tasks and bees engaged in foraging. Using these results as a baseline, we then performed manipulative experiments to test whether the PI is responsive to dietary changes and/or changes in juvenile hormone (JH) levels. Results reveal a robust molecular signature of behavioral maturation in the PI, with a subset of gene expression changes consistent with changes elicited by JH treatment. In contrast, dietary changes did not induce transcriptomic changes in the PI consistent with behavioral maturation or JH treatment. Based on these results, we propose a new verbal model of the regulation of division of labor in honey bees in which the relationship between diet and nutritional physiology is attenuated, and in its place is a relationship between social signals and nutritional physiology that is mediated by JH.",2015-12,2/8/16 18:56,2/8/16 18:56,,4005-14,,,218,,J Exp Biol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,"The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:<br/>auth-address: Department of Entomology, UIUC, Urbana, IL 61801, USA.

Additionally, methylation levels of an intronic ARL17A CpG associated with rs242557 and that of an intronic MOBP CpG with rs1768208. MAPT and MOBP region risk alleles also associated with higher levels of neuropathology. Strongest associations were observed for rs242557/coiled bodies and tufted astrocytes; and for rs1768208/coiled bodies and tau threads. These findings suggest that PSP variants at MAPT and MOBP loci may confer PSP risk via influencing gene expression and tau neuropathology. MOBP, LRRC37A4, ARL17A and ARL17B warrant further assessment as candidate PSP risk genes. Our findings have implications for the mechanism of action of variants at some of the top PSP risk loci.",4/26/16,5/6/16 19:10,5/9/16 20:41,,,,,,,Acta Neuropathol.,,,,,,,,ENG,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 27115769,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27115769,,association; Brain tissue; Epigenetic; Genetic risk; Neuropathology traits; Progressive supranuclear palsy; transcription,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because grades are surrogates of intrinsic tumor behavior, characterizing the molecular phenotype of grade is of potential clinical importance. To identify molecular alterations underlying prostate cancers grades, we used microdissection to obtain specific cohorts of cancers cells corresponding to the most common Gleason patterns (patterns 3, 4, and 5) from 29 radical prostatectomy samples. We paired each cancers sample with matched benign lumenal prostate epithelial cells and profiled transcript abundance levels by microarray analysis. We identified an 86-gene model capable of distinguishing low-grade (pattern 3) from high-grade (patterns 4 and 5) cancerss. This model performed with 76% accuracy when applied to an independent set of 30 primary prostate carcinomas. Using tissue microarrays comprising >800 prostate samples, we confirmed a significant association between high levels of monoamine oxidase A expression and poorly differentiated cancerss by immunohistochemistry. We also confirmed grade-associated levels of defender against death (DAD1) protein and HSD17 beta4 transcripts by immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. The altered expression of these genes provides functional insights into grade-associated features of therapy resistance and tissue invasion.

Higher Gleason scores are associated with treatment failure. METHODS: CD26+ cancers cells were isolated from Gleason 3+3 (G3) and Gleason 4+4 (G4) tumors by cell sorting, and their gene expression or transcriptome was determined by Affymetrix DNA array analysis. Dataset analysis was used to determine gene expression similarities and differences between G3 and G4 as well as to prostate cancers cell lines and histologically normal prostate luminal cells. RESULTS: The G3 and G4 transcriptomes were compared to those of prostatic cell types of non-cancers, which included luminal, basal, stromal fibromuscular, and endothelial. A principal components analysis of the various transcriptome datasets indicated a closer relationship between luminal and G3 than luminal and G4. Dataset comparison also showed that the cancers transcriptomes differed substantially from those of prostate cancers cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Genes differentially expressed in cancers are potential biomarkers for cancers detection, and those differentially expressed between G3 and G4 are potential biomarkers for disease stratification given that G4 cancers is associated with poor outcomes.

From 85 published reports, which include 3,922 cases and 2,099 noncancersous control tissue samples, 63 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified in different stages of cervical cancers development (CIN 1-3 and CC). It was found that some of the dysregulated miRNAs were associated with specific stages of cervical cancers development. To illustrate the impact of miRNAs on the pathogenesis of cervical cancers, a miRNA-mRNA interaction network on selected pathways was built by integrating viral oncoproteins, dysregulated miRNAs and their predicted/validated targets. The results indicated that the deregulated miRNAs at the different stages of cervical cancers were functionally involved in several key cancers related pathways, such as cell cycle, p53 and Wnt signaling pathways. These dysregulated miRNAs could play an important role in cervical cancers development. Some of the stage-specific miRNAs can also be used as biomarkers for cancers classification and monitoring the progression of cancers development. This article is protected by copyright.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Chemotherapy response (primary outcome) and overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and platinum-free duration (secondary outcome). RESULTS: In 512 patients with ovarian cancers with available whole-exome sequencing data, mutations from 8 members of the ADAMTS family (ADAMTS mutations) with an overall mutation rate of approximately 10.4% were associated with a significantly higher chemotherapy sensitivity (100% for ADAMTS-mutated vs 64% for ADAMTS wild-type cases; P < .001) and longer platinum-free duration (median platinum-free duration, 21.7 months for ADAMTS-mutated vs http://dx.doi.org/10.1 months for ADAMTS wild-type cases; P = .001). Moreover, ADAMTS mutations were associated with significantly better OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54 [95% CI, 0.42-0.89]; P = .01 and median OS, 58.0 months for ADAMTS-mutated vs 41.3 months for ADAMTS wild-type cases) and PFS (HR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.38-0.70]; P < .001 and median PFS, 31.8 for ADAMTS-mutated vs 15.3 months for ADAMTS wild-type cases).

Such tools can enhance our understanding of human health and genetic diseases, such as cancers, by accurately classifying phenotypes, detecting the presence of disease, discriminating among cancers sub-types, predicting clinical outcomes, and characterizing disease progression. In the case of gene expression microarray data, standard statistical learning methods have been used to identify classifiers that can accurately distinguish disease phenotypes. However, these mathematical prediction rules are often highly complex, and they lack the convenience and simplicity desired for extracting underlying biological meaning or transitioning into the clinic. In this review, we survey a powerful collection of computational methods for analyzing transcriptomic microarray data that address these limitations. Relative Expression Analysis (RXA) is based only on the relative orderings among the expressions of a small number of genes. Specifically, we provide a description of the first and simplest example of RXA, the K-TSP classifier, which is based on _ pairs of genes; the case K = 1 is the TSP classifier. Given their simplicity and ease of biological interpretation, as well as their invariance to data normalization and parameter-fitting, these classifiers have been widely applied in aiding molecular diagnostics in a broad range of human cancerss. We review several studies which demonstrate accurate classification of disease phenotypes (e.g., cancers vs. normal), cancers subclasses (e.g., AML vs. ALL, GIST vs. LMS), disease outcomes (e.g., metastasis, survival), and diverse human pathologies assayed through blood-borne leukocytes.

The clinical effects of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have commonly been analyzed together; however, it is becoming increasingly apparent that these mutations do not have the same effects in OC. Recently, three major reports highlighted the unequal clinical characteristics of OCs with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. All studies demonstrated that BRCA2-mutated patients are associated with better survival and therapeutic response than BRCA1-mutated and wild-type patients with serous OC. The differing prognostic effects of the BRCA2 and BRCA1 mutations is likely due to differing roles of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in homologous recombination repair and a stronger association between the BRCA2 mutation and a hypermutator phenotype.

Multiple risk loci have been identified to date, however few loci have been replicated across independent linkage studies. In addition, most previous analyses have been hampered by the relatively poor information content provided by microsatellite scans. To overcome these issues, we have performed linkage analyses on members of 301 HPC families genotyped using the Illumina SNP linkage panel IVb. The information content for this panel, averaged over all pedigrees and all chromosomes, was 86% (range 83-87% over chromosomes). Analyses were also stratified on families according to disease aggressiveness, age at diagnosis and number of affected individuals to achieve more genetically homogeneous subsets. Suggestive evidence for linkage was identified at 7q21 (HLOD = 1.87), 8q22 (KCLOD = 1.88) and 15q13-q14 (HLOD = 1.99) in 289 Caucasian families, and nominal evidence for linkage was identified at 2q24 (LOD = 1.73) in 12 African American families.

Understanding these molecular mechanisms could provide important prognostic information relevant to more effective clinical management of this heterogeneous cancers. Hence, through genetic linkage analyses, we examined the hypothesis that the tendency to develop aggressive prostate cancers may have an important genetic component. Starting with 1,233 familial prostate cancers families with genome scan data available from the International Consortium for Prostate cancers Genetics, we selected those that had at least three members with the phenotype of clinically aggressive prostate cancers, as defined by either high tumor grade and/or stage, resulting in 166 pedigrees (13%). Genome-wide linkage data were then pooled to perform a combined linkage analysis for these families. Linkage signals reaching a suggestive level of significance were found on chromosomes 6p22.3 (LOD = 3.0), 11q14.1-14.3 (LOD = 2.4), and 20p11.21-q11.21 (LOD = 2.5). For chromosome 11, stronger evidence of linkage (LOD = 3.3) was observed among pedigrees with an average at diagnosis of 65 years or younger. Other chromosomes that showed evidence for heterogeneity in linkage across strata were chromosome 7, with the strongest linkage signal among pedigrees without male-to-male disease transmission (7q21.11, LOD = 4.1), and chromosome 21, with the strongest linkage signal among pedigrees that had African American ancestry (21q22.13-22.3; LOD = 3.2). Our findings suggest several regions that may contain genes which, when mutated, predispose men to develop a more aggressive prostate cancers phenotype.

This hypothesis implies that a nonlinear stochastic mathematical cancers model is constructible based on available experimental data and its quantitative prediction is directly testable. Within such model the genesis and progression of cancers may be viewed as stochastic transitions between different attractors. Thus it further suggests that progressions are not arbitrary.

METHODS: We created a map that connects genes to cancers hallmarks via signaling pathways. We projected gene mutation and focal copy number data from various cancers types onto this map. We performed statistical analyses to uncover mutually exclusive and co-occurring oncogenic aberrations within this topology. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that although the genetic fingerprint of tumor types could be very different, there were less variations at the level of hallmarks, consistent with the idea that different genetic alterations have similar functional outcomes. Additionally, we showed how the multilevel map could help to clarify the role of infrequently mutated genes, and we demonstrated that mutually exclusive gene mutations were more prevalent in pathways, whereas many co-occurring gene mutations were associated with hallmark characteristics.

The mechanism of this transition is unknown. A systems approach to disease begins with the quantitative delineation of the informational elements (mRNAs and proteins) in various disease states. We employed two recently developed high-throughput technologies, massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) and isotope-coded affinity tag, to gain a comprehensive picture of the changes in mRNA levels and more restricted analysis of protein levels, respectively, during the transition from androgen-dependent LNCaP (model for early-stage prostate cancers) to androgen-independent CL1 cells (model for late-stage prostate cancers). We sequenced >5 million MPSS signatures, obtained >142,000 tandem mass spectra, and built comprehensive MPSS and proteomic databases. The integrated mRNA and protein expression data revealed underlying functional differences between androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancers cells. The high sensitivity of MPSS enabled us to identify virtually all of the expressed transcripts and to quantify the changes in gene expression between these two cell states, including functionally important low-abundance mRNAs, such as those encoding transcription factors and signal transduction molecules. These data enable us to map the differences onto extant physiologic networks, creating perturbation networks that reflect prostate cancers progression.

However, the ubiquitous non-genetic heterogeneity and plasticity of tumour cell phenotype raises the question: are mutations really necessary and sufficient to promote cell phenotype changes during tumour progression? cancers therapy inevitably spares some cancers cells, even in the absence of resistant mutants. Accumulating observations suggest that the non-killed, residual tumour cells actively acquire a new phenotype simply by exploiting their developmental potential. These surviving cells are stressed by the cytotoxic treatment, and owing to phenotype plasticity, exhibit a variety of responses. Some are pushed into nearby, latent attractor states of the gene regulatory network which resemble evolutionary ancient or early developmental gene expression programs that confer stemness and resilience. By entering such stem-like, stress-response states, the surviving cells strengthen their capacity to cope with future noxious agents. Considering non-genetic cell state dynamics and the relative ease with which surviving but stressed cells can be tipped into latent attractors provides a foundation for exploring new therapeutic approaches that seek not only to kill cancers cells but also to avoid promoting resistance and relapse that are inherently linked to the attempts to kill them.",5/26/15,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,1725-32,,,112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whole-genome microarray analysis identified genes induced by TSA (653) or 5-AzaC treatment (170). We selected a subset of reactivated genes that were markedly induced (greater than two-fold) after treatment with either TSA or 5-AzaC in a majority of glioma cell lines but not in cultured normal astrocytes. We then characterized the degree of promoter methylation and transcriptional silencing of selected genes in histologically confirmed human tumor and nontumor brain specimens. We identified two novel brain expressed genes, BEX1 and BEX2, which were silenced in all tumor specimens and exhibited extensive promoter hypermethylation. Viral-mediated reexpression of either BEX1 or BEX2 led to increased sensitivity to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and potent tumor suppressor effects in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model.

Using this principle we have integrated the three best performing and complementary algorithms into a framework for inference of regulation by miRNAs (FIRM) from sets of co-expressed genes. We demonstrate the utility of FIRM by inferring a cancers-miRNA regulatory network through the analysis of 2,240 gene co-expression signatures from 46 cancerss. By analyzing this network for functional enrichment of known hallmarks of cancers we have discovered a subset of 13 miRNAs that regulate oncogenic processes across diverse cancerss.

Further, we highlight the specificity of using FIRM inferences to identify miRNA regulated genes by experimentally validating that miR-767-5p, which partially shares the miR-29 seed sequence, regulates only a subset of miR-29 targets. By providing mechanistic linkage between miRNA dysregulation in cancers, their binding sites in the 3â€°Ã›Âª UTRs of specific sets of co-expressed genes, and their associations with known hallmarks of cancers, FIRM and the inferred cancers miRNA-regulatory network will serve as a powerful public resource for discovery of potential cancers biomarkers.",6/28/12,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of four stem cell transcription factor (TF) genes, LIN28A, NANOG, POU5F1, SOX2, were analyzed in the LuCaP lines. These genes, when force expressed in differentiated cells, can reprogram the recipients into stem-like induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Most LuCaP lines expressed POU5F1, while LuCaP 145.1, representative of small cell carcinoma, expressed all four. Through transcriptome database query, many small cell carcinoma genes were also found in stem cells. To test the hypothesis that prostate cancers progression from ""differentiated"" adenocarcinoma to ""undifferentiated"" small cell carcinoma could involve re-expression of stem cell genes, the four TF genes were transfected via lentiviral vectors into five adenocarcinoma LuCaP lines - 70CR, 73CR, 86.2, 92, 105CR - as done in iPS cell reprogramming. The resultant cells from these five transfections displayed a morphology of small size and dark appearing unlike the parentals. Transcriptome analysis of LuCaP 70CR* (* to denote transfected progeny) revealed a unique gene expression close to that of LuCaP 145.1. In a prostate principal components analysis space based on cell-type transcriptomes, the different LuCaP transcriptome datapoints were aligned to suggest a possible ordered sequence of expression changes from the differentiated luminal-like adenocarcinoma cell types to the less differentiated, more stem-like small cell carcinoma types and LuCaP 70CR*. Prostate cancers progression can thus be molecularly characterized by loss of differentiation with re-expression of stem cell genes. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: Expression of DKK1 and beta-catenin was investigated in HCC cell lines using qRT-PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Tissue microarrays representing 314 HCC patients were used to determine the expression patterns of DKK1 and beta-catenin by immunohistochemistry, and prognostic significance was assessed by using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank tests. RESULTS: The expression level of DKK1 was associated with the staining pattern of beta-catenin in HCC cell lines, and DKK1 overexpression correlated with beta-catenin cytoplasmic/nuclear accumulation in clinical HCC samples (P=0.011, correlation coefficient=0.144). High DKK1 expression predicted unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients, especially in early stage patients and those with normal AFP levels. In multivariate analyses, DKK1 was an independent predictor for overall survival (OS) (P=0.002) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P=0.002) of HCC patients. Furthermore, the HCC patients with high DKK1 expression and cytoplasmic/nuclear beta-catenin accumulation had very poor prognosis.

However, the coexistence of a vast diversity of distinct clones, most prominently visible in the form of non-clonal chromosomal aberrations, suggests that Darwinian selection of mutant cells is not operating at maximal efficacy. Conversely, non-genetic instability of cancers cells must also be considered. Such mutation-independent instability of cell states is most prosaically manifest in the phenotypic heterogeneity within clonal cell populations or in the reversible switching between immature ""cancers stem cell-like"" and more differentiated states. How are genetic and non-genetic instability related to each other? Here, we review basic theoretical foundations and offer a dynamical systems perspective in which cancers is the inevitable pathological manifestation of modes of malfunction that are immanent to the complex gene regulatory network of the genome. We explain in an accessible, qualitative, and permissively simplified manner the mathematical basis for the ""epigenetic landscape"" and how the latter relates to the better known ""fitness landscape."" We show that these two classical metaphors have a formal basis. By combining these two landscape concepts, we unite development and somatic evolution as the drivers of the relentless increase in malignancy. Herein, the cancers cells are pushed toward cancers attractors in the evolutionarily unused regions of the epigenetic landscape that encode more and more ""dedifferentiated"" states as a consequence of both genetic (mutagenic) and non-genetic (regulatory) perturbations-including therapy. This would explain why for the cancers cell, the principle of ""What does not kill me makes me stronger"" is as much a driving force in tumor progression and development of drug resistance as the simple principle of ""survival of the fittest.""",2013-12,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,423-48,,4-Mar,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, hydrazide-based chemistry was used to identify N-linked glycopeptides from 22Rv1 prostate cancers cells cultured in vitro, which were compared with glycopeptides identified from explanted 22Rv1 murine tumor xenografts. One hundred and four human glycoproteins were identified in the former analysis and 75 in the latter, with 40 proteins overlapping between data sets. Of the 40 overlapping proteins, 80% have multiple literature references to the neoplastic process and approximately 40% to prostatic neoplasms. These include a number of well-known prostate cancers-associated biomarkers, such as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). By integrating gene expression data and available literature, we identified members of the overlap data set that deserve consideration as potential prostate cancers biomarkers. Specifically, the identification of the extracellular domain of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) was of particular interest due to the direct involvement of PTPRF in the control of beta-catenin signaling, as well as dramatically elevated gene expression levels in the prostate compared to other tissues. In this investigation, we demonstrate that the PTPRF E-subunit is more abundant in human prostate tumor tissue compared to normal control and also detectable in murine plasma by immunoblot and ELISA. Specifically, PTPRF distinguishes between animals xenografted with the 22Rv1 cells and control animals as early as 14 days after implantation. This result suggests that the ectodomain of PTPRF has the potential to function as a novel plasma or tissue-based biomarker for prostate cancers.

We aimed to describe a collection of high-risk prostate cancers families and assess linkage to multiple markers at four loci: HPC1 (1q24-25), PCaP (1q42.2-43), HPCX (Xq27-28), and CAPB (1p36). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Medical record data on 505 affected men in 149 multiply-affected prostate cancers families were reviewed, and correlations of clinical traits within each family were calculated. Logarithm of odds (LOD) score and nonparametric (NPL) linkage analyses were performed; white families were stratified by age of diagnosis, grade and stage of disease, and evidence of linkage to the other loci to increase genetic homogeneity. RESULTS: Age at diagnosis was the most correlated clinical trait within families. A maximum NPL score of 2.61 (P = 0.007) appeared to confirm HPC1 linkage for families that had a prevalence of high-grade or advanced-stage prostate cancers and which were not likely to be linked to PCaP, HPCX, or CAPB. Because the NPL scores improved when families more likely to be linked to the other loci were excluded, HPC1 may act independently of the other loci. The relationship of HPC1 and aggressive disease was strongest in families with median age at diagnosis > or =65 years (NPL, 3.48; P = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that HPC1 linkage may be most common among families with more severe prostate cancers.

These analyses support the existence of multiple HPC loci, whose presence may be best identified by analyses of large, including pooled, datasets which consider locus heterogeneity.",12/1/03,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,309-19,,4,57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aged; Brain Neoplasms/genetics; BRCA1; BRCA2; Breast Neoplasms/genetics; DNA; Family; Female; Genes; Genetic Markers/genetics; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome; Human; Humans; Linkage (Genetics)/genetics; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation/genetics; Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics; Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Prostatic Neoplasms/ genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although genomewide screens have been performed in over a dozen independent studies, few chromosomal regions have been consistently identified as regions of interest. One of the major difficulties is genetic heterogeneity, possibly due to multiple, incompletely penetrant PC-susceptibility genes. In this study, we explored two approaches to overcome this difficulty, in an analysis of a large number of families with PC in the International Consortium for Prostate cancers Genetics (ICPCG). One approach was to combine linkage data from a total of 1,233 families to increase the statistical power for detecting linkage. Using parametric (dominant and recessive) and nonparametric analyses, we identified five regions with ""suggestive"" linkage (LOD score >1.86): 5q12, 8p21, 15q11, 17q21, and 22q12. The second approach was to focus on subsets of families that are more likely to segregate highly penetrant mutations, including families with large numbers of affected individuals or early age at diagnosis. Stronger evidence of linkage in several regions was identified, including a ""significant"" linkage at 22q12, with a LOD score of 3.57, and five suggestive linkages (1q25, 8q13, 13q14, 16p13, and 17q21) in 269 families with at least five affected members. In addition, four additional suggestive linkages (3p24, 5q35, 11q22, and Xq12) were found in 606 families with mean age at diagnosis of < or = 65 years. Although it is difficult to determine the true statistical significance of these findings, a conservative interpretation of these results would be that if major PC-susceptibility genes do exist, they are most likely located in the regions generating suggestive or significant linkage signals in this large study.",2005-08,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,219-29,,2,77,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aged; Chromosome Mapping; Family Health; Genetic Markers; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome; Genotype; Human; Humans; International Cooperation; Linkage (Genetics); Lod Score; Male; Middle Aged; Pedigree; Prostatic Neoplasms/ genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their acquisition is explained by the somatic mutation theory: tumor progression is the result of a neo-Darwinian evolution in the tissue. Herein cells are the units of selection. Random genetic mutations permanently affecting these pathways create malignant cell phenotypes that are selected for in the disturbed tissue. However, could it be that the capacity of the genome and its gene regulatory network to generate the vast diversity of cell types during development, i.e., to produce inheritable phenotypic changes without mutations, is harnessed by tumorigenesis to propel a directional change towards malignancy? Here we take an encompassing perspective, transcending the orthodoxy of molecular carcinogenesis and review mechanisms of somatic evolution beyond the Neo-Darwinian scheme. We discuss the central concept of ""cancers attractors"" - the hidden stable states of gene regulatory networks normally not occupied by cells. Noise-induced transitions into such attractors provide a source for randomness (chance) and regulatory constraints (necessity) in the acquisition of novel expression profiles that can be inherited across cell divisions, and hence, can be selected for. But attractors can also be reached in response to environmental signals - thus offering the possibility for inheriting acquired traits that can also be selected for. Therefore, we face the possibility of non-genetic (mutation-independent) equivalents to both Darwinian and Lamarckian evolution which may jointly explain the arrow of change pointing toward increasing malignancy.",5/11/12,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report on linkage analysis at this putative HPCX locus in an independent set of 186 prostate cancers families participating in the Prostate cancers Genetic Research Study (PROGRESS). METHODS: DNA samples from these families were genotyped at 8 polymorphic markers spanning 14.3 cM of the HPCX region. RESULTS: Two-point parametric analysis of the total data set resulted in positive lod scores at only two markers, DXS984 and DXS1193, with scores of 0.628 at a recombination fraction (theta) of 0.36 and 0.012 at theta = 0.48, respectively. The stratification of pedigrees according to the assumed mode of transmission increased the evidence of linkage at DXS984 in 81 families with no evidence of male-to-male transmission (lod = 1.062 at theta = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Although this analysis did not show statistically significant evidence for the linkage of prostate cancers susceptibility to Xq27-28, the results are consistent with a small percentage of families being linked to this region.

The p36 region of chromosome one has been reported to have frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors and epidemiological studies have shown an increased relative risk of BC and tumors of the CNS in PC families. In 1997 a reported tumor suppressor with high homology to p53, termed p73, was mapped to the p36 region of chromosome one. Here, we examine the p73 gene as a potential candidate for CAPB. METHODS: Ninety-four members from the 12 prostate-brain cancers families in which linkage was originally found were examined. The complete coding region and intron-exon boundaries of the p73 gene were analyzed for germline mutations by Single Stranded Conformational Polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Silent nucleotide substitutions only were detected within the coding regions of the gene in affected individuals. Nucleotide changes were detected in introns 1, 6, 8, 9, and 10, but all were located >or=16 base pairs from the splice site, and are thus unlikely to be deleterious mutations.

Heterozygous inactivating germline mutations of armadillo repeat containing 5 (ARMC5) have very recently been described as cause for sporadic PMAH. Whether this genetic condition also causes familial PMAH in association with other neoplasias is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to delineate the molecular cause in a large family with PMAH and other neoplasias. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing and comprehensive clinical and biochemical phenotyping was performed in members of a PMAH affected family. Nodules derived from adrenal surgery and pancreatic and meningeal tumor tissue were analyzed for accompanying somatic mutations in the identified target genes. RESULTS: PMAH presenting either as overt or subclinical Cushingâ€°Ã›Âªs syndrome was accompanied by a heterozygous germline mutation in ARMC5 (p.A110fs*9) located on chromosome 16. Analysis of tumor tissue showed different somatic ARMC5 mutations in adrenal nodules supporting a second hit hypothesis with inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. A damaging somatic ARMC5 mutation was also found in a concomitant meningioma (p.R502fs) but not in a pancreatic tumor, suggesting biallelic inactivation of ARMC5 as causal also for the intracranial meningioma. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis further confirms inherited inactivating ARMC5 mutations as a cause of familial PMAH and suggests an additional role for the development of concomitant intracranial meningiomas.",2015-01,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,E119-28,,1,100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This complexity presents substantial challenges for the characterization of cancers biology, and motivates the study of cancers in the context of molecular, cellular, and physiological systems. Computational models of cancers are being developed to aid both biological discovery and clinical medicine. The development of these in silico models is facilitated by rapidly advancing experimental and analytical tools that generate information-rich, high-throughput biological data. Statistical models of cancers at the genomic, transcriptomic, and pathway levels have proven effective in developing diagnostic and prognostic molecular signatures, as well as in identifying perturbed pathways. Statistically inferred network models can prove useful in settings where data overfitting can be avoided, and provide an important means for biological discovery. Mechanistically based signaling and metabolic models that apply a priori knowledge of biochemical processes derived from experiments can also be reconstructed where data are available, and can provide insight and predictive ability regarding the behavior of these systems.

However, a significant diagnostic challenge remains in the differentiation of GIST from leiomyosarcomas (LMSs). To improve on the diagnostic evaluation and to complement the immunohistochemical evaluation of these tumors, we performed a whole-genome gene expression study on 68 well characterized tumor samples. Using bioinformatic approaches, we devised a two-gene relative expression classifier that distinguishes between GIST and LMS with an accuracy of 99.3% on the microarray samples and an estimated accuracy of 97.8% on future cases. We validated this classifier by using RT-PCR on 20 samples in the microarray study and on an additional 19 independent samples, with 100% accuracy. Thus, our two-gene relative expression classifier is a highly accurate diagnostic method to distinguish between GIST and LMS and has the potential to be rapidly implemented in a clinical setting. The success of this classifier is likely due to two general traits, namely that the classifier is independent of data normalization and that it uses as simple an approach as possible to achieve this independence to avoid overfitting. We expect that the use of simple marker pairs that exhibit these traits will be of significant clinical use in a variety of contexts.",2/27/07,2/8/16 23:58,2/9/16 0:19,,3414-3419,,9,104,,"PNAS, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences",,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,"Algorithms; Blotting, Western; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics; Computational Biology/methods; Diagnosis, Differential; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/classification/*genetics; Genetic Markers/genetics; Genomics/methods; Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*genetics; Humans; Leiomyosarcoma/classification/*genetics; Muscle Proteins/*genetics; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Open Reading Frames/*genetics; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two next-generation sequencing technologiesâ€°Ã›Ã’MPSS (massively parallel signature sequencing) and SBS (sequencing by synthesis)â€°Ã›Ã’were used to sequence the transcripts of IGROV1 and IGROV1-CP cells, and to sequence the transcripts of a highly chemotherapy responsive and a highly chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancers tissue. RESULTS: We identified 3422 signatures (2957 genes) that are significantly different between IGROV1 and IGROV1-CP cells (P<0.001). Gene Ontology (GO) term GO:0001837 (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition) and GO:0034330 (cell junction assembly and maintenance) are enriched in genes that are over expressed in IGROV1-CP cells while apoptosis-related GO terms are enriched in genes over expressed in IGROV1 cells. We identified 1187 tags (corresponding to 1040 genes) that are differentially expressed between the chemotherapy responsive and the persistently chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancers tissues. GO term GO:0050673 (epithelial cell proliferation) and GO:0050678 (regulation of epithelial cell proliferation) are enriched in the genes over expressed in the chemotherapy resistant tissue while the GO:0007229 (integrin-mediated signaling pathway) is enriched in the genes over expressed in the chemotherapy sensitive tissue. An integrative analysis identified 111 common differentially expressed genes including two bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP4 and BMP7), six solute carrier proteins (SLC10A3, SLC16A3, SLC25A1, SLC35B3, SLC7A5 and SLC7A7), transcription factor POU5F1 (POU class 5 homeobox 1), and KLK10 (kallikrein-related peptidase 10). A network analysis revealed a subnetwork with three genes BMP7, NR2F2 and AP2B1 that were consistently over expressed in the chemoresistant tissue or cells compared to the chemosensitive tissue or cells.

To investigate whether it plays an important role in the development of prostate cancers (PRCA) in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population, we sequenced CHEK2 in 75 AJ individuals with prostate, breast, or no cancers (n=25 each). We identified seven coding SNPs (five are novel) that changed the amino-acid sequence, resulting in R3W, E394F, Y424H, S428F, D438Y, P509S, and P509L. We determined the frequency of each variant in 76 AJ families collected by members of the International Consortium for Prostate cancers Genetics (ICPCG) where >or=2 men were affected by PRCA. Only one variant, Y424H in exon 11, was identified in more than two families. Exon 11 was then screened in nine additional AJ ICPCG families (a total of 85 families). The Y424H variant occurred in nine affected cases from four different families; however, it did not completely segregate with the disease. We performed bioinformatics analysis, which showed that Y424H is a non-conservative missense substitution that falls at a position that is invariant in vertebrate CHEK2 orthologs. Both SIFT and Align-GVGD predict that Y424H is a loss of function mutation. However, the frequency of Y424H was not significantly different between unselected AJ cases from Montreal/Memorial Sloan Kettering cancers Centre (MSKCC) and AJ controls from Israel/MSKCC (OR 1.18, 95%CI: 0.34-4.61, p=.99). Moreover, functional assays using Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that the Y424H substitution did not alter function of CHEK2 protein.

Their identity has been linked to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) but remains highly controversial since-depending on the cell-line studied-either epithelial (E) or mesenchymal (M) markers, alone or together have been associated with stemness. Using distinct transcript expression signatures characterizing the three different E, M and hybrid E/M cell-types, our data support a novel model that links a mixed EM signature with stemness in 1) individual cells, 2) luminal and basal cell lines, 3) in vivo xenograft mouse models, and 4) in all breast cancers subtypes. In particular, we found that co-expression of E and M signatures was associated with poorest outcome in luminal and basal breast cancers patients as well as with enrichment for stem-like cells in both E and M breast cell-lines. This link between a mixed EM expression signature and stemness was explained by two findings: first, mixed cultures of E and M cells showed increased cooperation in mammosphere formation (indicative of stemness) compared to the more differentiated E and M cell-types. Second, single-cell qPCR analysis revealed that E and M genes could be co-expressed in the same cell. These hybrid E/M cells were generated by both E or M cells and had a combination of several stem-like traits since they displayed increased plasticity, self-renewal, mammosphere formation, and produced ALDH1+ progenies, while more differentiated M cells showed less plasticity and E cells showed less self-renewal. Thus, the hybrid E/M state reflecting stemness and its promotion by E-M cooperation offers a dual biological rationale for the robust association of the mixed EM signature with poor prognosis, independent of cellular origin. Together, our model explains previous paradoxical findings that breast CSCs appear to be M in luminal cell-lines but E in basal breast cancers cell-lines. Our results suggest that targeting E/M heterogeneity by eliminating hybrid E/M cells and cooperation between E and M cell-types could improve breast cancers patient survival independent of breast cancers-subtype.",2015,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e0126522,,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using colon carcinoma cell lines stably transfected with NGAL or antisense NGAL, we showed that NGAL overexpression altered subcellular localization of E-cadherin and catenins, decreased E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, enhanced cell-matrix attachment, and increased cell motility and in vitro invasion. Conversely, a decrease in NGAL enhanced more aggregated growth pattern and decreased in vitro invasion. We further showed that NGAL exerted these effects through the alteration of the subcellular localization of Rac1 in an extracellular matrix-dependent, but MMP9-independent, manner. Furthermore, we observed that the NGAL-overexpressing cells tolerated increased iron levels in the culture environment, whereas the NGAL-underexpressing cells showed significant cell death after prolonged incubation in high-iron condition. Thus, overexpressing NGAL in colon carcinomas is an important regulatory molecule that integrates extracellular environment cues, iron metabolism, and intracellular small GTPase signaling in cancers migration and invasion.

Linkage studies attempting to map genes for hereditary prostate cancers (HPC) have proved challenging, and one potential problem contributing to this challenge is the variability in disease phenotypes. METHODS: We collected clinical data on 784 affected men with prostate cancers from 248 HPC families for whom a genomic screen was performed. Disease characteristics (i.e., Gleason score, stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA)) were used to classify affected men into categories of clinically insignificant, moderate, or aggressive prostate cancers. To potentially enrich for a genetic etiology, we restricted linkage analyses to only men with aggressive disease, although we used genotype information from all family members; linkage analyses used both dominant and recessive models. In addition, subset analyses considered age at diagnosis, number of affected men per family and other stratifications to try to increase genetic homogeneity. RESULTS: Several regions of interest (heterogeneity LOD score, HLOD>1.0) were identified in families (n=123) with >or=2 affecteds with aggressive prostate cancers. ""Suggestive"" linkage was observed at chromosome 22q11.1 (Dominant model HLOD=2.18) and the result was stronger (Dominant HLOD=2.75) in families with evidence of male-to-male transmission. A second region at 22q12.3-q13.1 was also highlighted (Recessive model HLOD=1.90) among men with aggressive disease, as was a region on chromosome 18.

Blood plasma was collected from 10 control mice, and 10 mice having a mutation in the p19(ARF) gene, conferring them high propensity to develop skin cancers after carcinogen exposure. We enriched for N-glycosylated plasma proteins, ultimately generating deglycosylated forms of the modified tryptic peptides for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses. LC-MS runs for each sample were then performed with a view to identifying proteins that were differentially abundant between the two mouse populations. We then used a recently developed computational framework, Corra, to perform peak picking and alignment, and to compute the statistical significance of any observed changes in individual peptide abundances. Once determined, the most discriminating peptide features were then fragmented and identified by tandem mass spectrometry with the use of inclusion lists. We next assessed the identified proteins to see if there were sets of proteins indicative of specific biological processes that correlate with the presence of disease, and specifically cancers, according to their functional annotations. As expected for such sick animals, many of the proteins identified were related to host immune response. However, a significant number of proteins also directly associated with processes linked to cancers development, including proteins related to the cell cycle, localisation, trasport, and cell death. Additional analysis of the same samples in profiling mode, and in triplicate, confirmed that replicate MS analysis of the same plasma sample generated less variation than that observed between plasma samples from different individuals, demonstrating that the reproducibility of the LC-MS platform was sufficient for this application. These results thus show that an LC-MS-based workflow can be a useful tool for the generation of candidate proteins of interest as part of a disease biomarker discovery effort.",12/1/08,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,105,,4-Mar,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their presence in the tumor may herald malignancy potential, mediate resistance to conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and confer poor survival outcomes. Thus, CSC may serve as critical cellular targets for treatment. The ability to therapeutically target CSC hinges upon identifying their unique cell surface markers and the underlying survival signaling pathways. While accumulating evidence suggests cell-surface antigens (such as CD44, CD133) as CSC markers for several tumor tissues, emerging clinical needs exist for the identification of new markers to completely separate CSC from normal stem cells. Recent studies have demonstrated the critical role of the tumor suppressor PTEN/PI3 kinase pathway in regulating TIC in leukemia, brain, and intestinal tissues. The successful eradication of tumors by therapies targeting CSC will require an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing CSC self renewal, differentiation, and escape from conventional therapy.

Unlike LNCaP, the other cell lines show features of progressed disease such as metastatic capability and hormone independence. Analyses were done to determine if C4-2 or CL1 cells were selected from pre-existent subpopulations in LNCaP. METHODS: Prostate cancers cells were characterized by cluster designation (CD) phenotyping. Specific cell populations were sorted by flow cytometry. DNA array analysis was used to probe differential gene expression. RESULTS: CD phenotyping showed that CL1 and C4-2 (and C4-2B) were very dissimilar, and C4-2 was more similar to LNCaP. One common difference between LNCaP and its derivatives was CD26, in which virtually all C4-2 or CL1 cells were CD26(+) but only approximately 10% of LNCaP cells were CD26(+). The CD26(+) subpopulation of LNCaP was isolated and cultured in vitro.

However, despite their pleiotropic effects on cells, little is known about the role of these epoxyeicosanoids in cancers. Here, using genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endogenous EET levels, we demonstrate that EETs are critical for primary tumor growth and metastasis in a variety of mouse models of cancers. Remarkably, we found that EETs stimulated extensive multiorgan metastasis and escape from tumor dormancy in several tumor models. This systemic metastasis was not caused by excessive primary tumor growth but depended on endothelium-derived EETs at the site of metastasis. Administration of synthetic EETs recapitulated these results, while EET antagonists suppressed tumor growth and metastasis, demonstrating in vivo that pharmacological modulation of EETs can affect cancers growth. Furthermore, inhibitors of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), the enzyme that metabolizes EETs, elevated endogenous EET levels and promoted primary tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, our data indicate a central role for EETs in tumorigenesis, offering a mechanistic link between lipid signaling and cancers and emphasizing the critical importance of considering possible effects of EET-modulating drugs on cancers.",1/3/12,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,178-91,,,122,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Eicosanoids; Endothelium; Epoxy Compounds; Experimental; Humans; Inbred C57BL; Knockout; Male; Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasms; Neovascularization; Pathologic; Recombinant Proteins; Transgenic; Vascular; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used a large-scale RNAi screen to identify MED12, a component of the transcriptional MEDIATOR complex that is mutated in cancerss, as a determinant of response to ALK and EGFR inhibitors. MED12 is in part cytoplasmic where it negatively regulates TGF-betaR2 through physical interaction. MED12 suppression therefore results in activation of TGF-betaR signaling, which is both necessary and sufficient for drug resistance. TGF-beta signaling causes MEK/ERK activation, and consequently MED12 suppression also confers resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors in other cancerss. MED12 loss induces an EMT-like phenotype, which is associated with chemotherapy resistance in colon cancers patients and to gefitinib in lung cancers.

One such integrative concept, derived from first principles of the dynamics of gene regulatory networks, is that cancersous cell states are attractor states, just like normal cell types are. Here we extend the concept of cancers attractors to illuminate a more profound property of cancers initiation: its inherent inevitability in the light of metazoan evolution. Using Waddingtonâ€°Ã›Âªs Epigenetic Landscape as a conceptual aid, for which we present a mathematical and evolutionary foundation, we propose that cancers is intrinsically linked to ontogenesis and phylogenesis. This explanatory rather than enumerating review uses a formal argumentation structure that is atypical in modern experimental biology but may hopefully offer a new coherent perspective to reconcile many conflicts between new findings and the old thinking in the categories of linear oncogenic pathways.",2011-06,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,183-99,,3,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified WDR19 as a prostate-specific, androgen-regulated gene. Here, we evaluate its utility as a prostate cancers tissue marker for diagnosis and prognostic evaluation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Real-time quantitative PCR was done on a panel of prostate tissue isolated by laser capture microdissection. After generating antibodies against WDR19, tissue microarrays (TMA) were employed to compare WDR19 expression between normal, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and prostate cancers tissue. RESULTS: Using microarrays and real-time quantitative PCR, we showed that WDR19 mRNA expression was increased in cancers. We further showed that WDR19 protein is localized to cytoplasmic subcellular granules and is expressed exclusively in prostate epithelia. Large-scale immunohistochemical staining using TMAs reveals a significant percentage of increase in intensely staining tissue cores in cancers tissue when compared with normal or benign prostatic hyperplastic tissue. Based on the analysis of a separate TMA for which clinical follow-up information was available, low-intensity WDR19 staining was significantly associated with decreased time to biochemical failure (P = 0.006) and with decreased time to locoregional recurrence (P = 0.050). CONCLUSIONS: WDR19 should be added to the list of prostate cancers tissue markers. The continued expansion of a multiple-marker panel will conceivably increase the sensitivity and specificity of prostate cancers diagnosis and prognosis.",3/1/08,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,1397-406,,5,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adenocarcinoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology; Animals; Antibodies; Biological/genetics/metabolism; Blotting; Follow-Up Studies; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Local/ pathology; Male; Messenger/genetics/metabolism; Mice; Monoclonal/immunology/metabolism; Neoplasm Recurrence; Neoplastic/ physiology; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Prognosis; Prostate-Specific Antigen/metabolism; Prostatic Hyperplasia/genetics/metabolism/pathology; Prostatic Neoplasms/ genetics/metabolism/pathology; Proteins/ genetics; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA; Sensitivity and Specificity; Survival Rate; Time Factors; Tumor Markers; Western,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, dynamic non-genetic heterogeneity of clonal cell populations continuously produces metastable phenotypic variants (persisters), some of which represent stem-like states that confer resistance. Even without genetic mutations, Darwinian selection can expand these resistant variants, which would explain the invariably rapid emergence of stem-like resistant cells. Here, by using quantitative measurements and modelling, we show that appearance of multidrug resistance in HL60 leukemic cells following treatment with vincristine is not explained by Darwinian selection but by Lamarckian induction. Single-cell longitudinal monitoring confirms the induction of multidrug resistance in individual cells. Associated transcriptome changes indicate a lasting stress response consistent with a drug-induced switch between high-dimensional cancers attractors. Resistance induction correlates with Wnt pathway upregulation and is suppressed by beta-catenin knockdown, revealing a new opportunity for early therapeutic intervention against the development of drug resistance.",2013,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,2467,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significance analysis of microarray was used to identify marker genes of each subtype that were subject to pathway analysis. Association of molecular subtypes with clinical features and mutation data was analyzed with the Mann Whitney, Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Survival analysis was evaluated with log-rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided.

The recently developed sumLINK and sumLOD statistics are powerful tools for linkage analysis in the presence of heterogeneity. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of 1,233 PC pedigrees from the International Consortium for Prostate cancers Genetics (ICPCG) using two novel statistics, the sumLINK and sumLOD. For both statistics, dominant and recessive genetic models were considered. False discovery rate (FDR) analysis was conducted to assess the effects of multiple testing. RESULTS: Our analysis identified significant linkage evidence at chromosome 22q12, confirming previous findings by the initial conventional analyses of the same ICPCG data. Twelve other regions were identified with genome-wide suggestive evidence for linkage. Seven regions (1q23, 5q11, 5q35, 6p21, 8q12, 11q13, 20p11-q11) are near loci previously identified in the initial ICPCG pooled data analysis or the subset of aggressive PC pedigrees. Three other regions (1p12, 8p23, 19q13) confirm loci reported by others, and two (2p24, 6q27) are novel susceptibility loci. FDR testing indicates that over 70% of these results are likely true positive findings. Statistical recombinant mapping narrowed regions to an average of 9 cM. CONCLUSIONS: Our results represent genomic regions with the greatest consistency of positive linkage evidence across a very large collection of high-risk PC pedigrees using new statistical tests that deal powerfully with heterogeneity.

Determining the molecular mechanisms involved in stromal-stem cell interaction could provide critical insight into prostate development and disease progression, particularly with regard to their relationship to and influence on the putative cancers stem cell. METHODS: Prostate and bladder stromal cells prepared from tissue specimens were co-cultured with the pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cell line NCCIT. Transcriptome analysis was used to characterize NCCIT cell response to prostate or bladder signaling. RESULTS: A systems approach demonstrated that prostate stromal cells were capable of inducing gene expression changes in NCCIT through secreted factors.

Major points include: Systems biology and computational approaches can make important contributions to research and development in key clinical aspects of cancers and of cancers treatment, and should be developed for understanding and application to diagnosis, biomarkers, cancers progression, drug development and treatment strategies. Development of new measurement technologies is central to successful systems approaches, and should be strongly encouraged. The systems view of disease combined with these new technologies and novel computational tools will over the next 5-20 years lead to medicine that is predictive, personalized, preventive and participatory (P4 medicine).Major initiatives are in progress to gather extremely wide ranges of data for both somatic and germ-line genetic variations, as well as gene, transcript, protein and metabolite expression profiles that are cancers-relevant. Electronic databases and repositories play a central role to store and analyze these data. These resources need to be developed and sustained. Understanding cellular pathways is crucial in cancers research, and these pathways need to be considered in the context of the progression of cancers at various stages. At all stages of cancers progression, major areas require modelling via systems and developmental biology methods including immune system reactions, angiogenesis and tumour progression.A number of mathematical models of an analytical or computational nature have been developed that can give detailed insights into the dynamics of cancers-relevant systems. These models should be further integrated across multiple levels of biological organization in conjunction with analysis of laboratory and clinical data.Biomarkers represent major tools in determining the presence of cancers, its progression and the responses to treatments. There is a need for sets of high-quality annotated clinical samples, enabling comparisons across different diseases and the quantitative simulation of major pathways leading to biomarker development and analysis of drug effects.Education is recognized as a key component in the success of any systems biology programme, especially for applications to cancers research. It is recognized that a balance needs to be found between the need to be interdisciplinary and the necessity of having extensive specialist knowledge in particular areas.A proposal from this workshop is to explore one or more types of cancers over the full scale of their progression, for example glioblastoma or colon cancers. Such an exemplar project would require all the experimental and computational tools available for the generation and analysis of quantitative data over the entire hierarchy of biological information.

Many of these genes have established relevance to the brain cancerss examined herein, with others having known roles in cancers biology. Analyses on large-scale data from multiple sources must deal with significant challenges associated with heterogeneity between different published studies, for it was observed that the variation among individual studies often had a larger effect on the transcriptome than did phenotype differences, as is typical. For this reason, we restricted ourselves to studying only cases where we had at least two independent studies performed for each phenotype, and also reprocessed all the raw data from the studies using a unified pre-processing pipeline. We found that learning signatures across multiple datasets greatly enhanced reproducibility and accuracy in predictive performance on truly independent validation sets, even when keeping the size of the training set the same. This was most likely due to the meta-signature encompassing more of the heterogeneity across different sources and conditions, while amplifying signal from the repeated global characteristics of the phenotype.

Systems approaches have demonstrated an ability to separate meaningful signal from noise that arises from population heterogeneity, heterogeneity within and across tumors, and multiple sources of technical variation when sufficient sample sizes are obtained and standardized measurement technologies are used. The ability to develop clinically useful molecular cancers diagnostics will be predicated on advancements on two major fronts: 1) more comprehensive and accurate measurements of multiple endpoints, and 2) more sophisticated analytical tools that synthesize high-throughput data into meaningful reflections of cellular states. To this end, systems approaches that have integrated transcriptomic data onto biomolecular networks have shown promise in their ability to classify tumor subtypes, predict clinical progression, and inform treatment options.

Immortalized and malignant EBV-carrying B-cell lines were used to explore this model and characterize the detailed structure of cell attractors. Any subpopulation selected from a population of cells repopulated the whole original basin of attraction within days to weeks. Cells at the basin edges were unstable and prone to apoptosis. Cells continuously changed states within their own attractor, thus driving the repopulation, as shown by fluorescent dye tracing. Perturbations of key regulatory genes induced a jump to a nearby attractor. Using the Fokker-Planck equation, this cell population behavior could be described as two virtual, opposing influences on the cells: one attracting toward the center and the other promoting diffusion in state space (noise).

Our mathematical framework showed that both growth and transition influence the ratio of cancers cell subpopulations but the latter is more significant. We derived the condition that different cancers cell types can maintain distinctive subpopulations and we also explain why there always exists a stable fixed ratio after cell sorting based on putative surface markers. The cell fraction ratio can be shifted by changing either the growth rates of the subpopulations (Darwinism selection) or by environment-instructed transitions (Lamarckism induction).

This 'medusa' architecture implies that the core genes are much stronger determinants of the realized gene expression profiles. To test this hypothesis, we examined the clustering of gene expression profiles into known tumor types to quantitatively demonstrate that TFs, and even more pronounced, microRNAs, are much stronger discriminators of tumor type specific gene expression patterns than a same number of randomly selected or metabolic genes. These findings lend support to the hypothesis of a medusa architecture and of the canalizing nature of regulation by microRNAs.

We have demonstrated recently that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha deficiency in the host leads to overt inflammation that suppresses angiogenesis via excess production of thrombospondin (TSP)-1 and prevents tumor growth. Hence, we speculated that pharmacologic activation of PPARalpha would promote tumor growth. Surprisingly, the PPARalpha agonist fenofibrate potently suppressed primary tumor growth in mice. This effect was not mediated by cancers-cell-autonomous antiproliferative mechanisms but by the inhibition of angiogenesis and inflammation in the host tissue. Although PPARalpha-deficient tumors were still susceptible to fenofibrate, absence of PPARalpha in the host animal abrogated the potent antitumor effect of fenofibrate. In addition, fenofibrate suppressed endothelial cell proliferation and VEGF production, increased TSP-1 and endostatin, and inhibited corneal neovascularization. Thus, both genetic abrogation of PPARalpha as well as its activation by ligands cause tumor suppression via overlapping antiangiogenic pathways.

A well-studied group of autacoid mediators that are the products of arachidonic acid metabolism include: the prostaglandins, leukotrienes, lipoxins and cytochrome P450 (CYP) derived bioactive products. These lipid mediators are collectively referred to as eicosanoids and are generated by distinct enzymatic systems initiated by cyclooxygenases (COX 1 and 2), lipoxygenases (5-LOX, 12-LOX, 15-LOXa, 15-LOXb), and cytochrome P450s, respectively.

Beyond their potent anti-inflammatory and anti-cancers effects, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and COX-2 specific inhibitors have been evaluated in both preclinical tumor models and clinical trials. Eicosanoid biosynthesis and actions can also be directly influenced by nutrients in the diet, as evidenced by the emerging role of omega-3 fatty acids in cancers prevention and treatment. Most research dedicated to using eicosanoids to inhibit tumor-associated inflammation has focused on the COX and LOX pathways.

We argue that cancers cells are trapped in abnormal attractors and discuss this concept in the light of recent ideas in cancers biology, including cancers genomics and cancers stem cells, as well as the implications for differentiation therapy.",2009-09,5/9/16 19:49,5/9/16 20:34,,869-876,,7,20,,Semin.

But it is difficult to reconcile the inexorable progression towards metastasis in virtually all carcinomas and the associated complex change of cancers cell phenotype, characterized by an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, with the random nature of gene mutations. Given their irreversible nature, it is also difficult to explain why certain metastatic carcinomas can reform normal tissue boundaries and remain dormant for years at distant sites. Here we propose an encompassing conceptual framework based on system-level dynamics of gene regulatory networks that may help reconcile these inconsistencies. The concepts of gene expression state space and attractors are introduced which provide a mathematical and molecular basis for an ""epigenetic landscape"". We then describe how cancers cells are trapped in ""embryonic attractors"" because of distortions of this landscape caused by mutational rewiring of the regulatory network. The implications of this concept for a new integrative understanding of tumor formation and metastatic progression are discussed. This formal framework of cancers progression unites mainstream genetic determinism with alternative ideas that emphasize non-genetic influences, including chronic growth stimulation,extracellular matrix remodeling, alteration of cell mechanics and disruption of tissue architecture.",2006,5/9/16 19:52,5/9/16 19:52,,27-54,,,26,,Breast Dis,A non-genetic basis for cancers progression and metastasis,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 17473364,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17473364,,"Breast Neoplasms; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Disease Progression; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Models, Biological; Neoplasm Metastasis; Nonlinear Dynamics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The A6H antigen had not been identified heretofore. Antigen from detergent extracts of renal cell carcinoma cells (7860) was immunoabsorbed with A6H-agarose, and the resin-bound proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The antigen had a molecular weight of approximately 120 kDa as determined by Western blots. The 120-kDa protein band was excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion, and the resulting peptides were separated and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS\MS). The tandem mass spectra of the eluting peptides were used in combination with the SEQUEST computer program to search a human National cancers Institute (NCI) protein database for the identity of the protein. The target antigen was shown to be dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), which is also known as the cluster differentiation antigen CD26. Flow analysis of the expression of the A6H antigen and of CD26 on 7860 cells and on peripheral blood lymphocytes supported the identification of the A6H antigen as DPP IV. Recognition that the A6H antigen is DPP IV/CD26 afforded the opportunity to compare previous studies on A6H with those on other anti-CD26 antibodies in terms of expression in cancers cell lines and various tissues and as co-stimulators of T-cell activation.",2001-08,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,231-6,,4,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Antibodies; Antigens; Blotting; Carcinoma; CD26/*immunology; Cells; Chromatography; Cultured; Electrophoresis; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Kidney/enzymology; Kidney Neoplasms/enzymology; Liquid/methods; Lymphocyte Activation; Mass Spectrometry/methods; Molecular Sequence Data; Monoclonal/*immunology; Neoplasm/*immunology/isolation & purification; Polyacrylamide Gel; Renal Cell/enzymology; T-Lymphocytes/immunology; Western,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective in this study was to characterize the temporal program of transcription that reflects the cellular response to androgens and to identify specific androgen-regulated genes (ARGs) or gene networks that participate in these responses. We used cDNA microarrays representing about 20,000 distinct human genes to profile androgen-responsive transcripts in the LNCaP adenocarcinoma cell line and identified 146 genes with transcript alterations more than 3-fold. Of these, 103 encode proteins with described functional roles, and 43 represent transcripts that have yet to be characterized. Temporal gene expression profiles grouped the ARGs into four distinct cohorts. Five uncharacterized ARGs demonstrated exclusive or high expression levels in the prostate relative to other tissues studied. A search of available DNA sequence upstream of 28 ARGs identified 25 with homology to the androgen response-element consensus-binding motif.

To identify the binding protein we employed sequence specific DNA affinity chromatography. Amino acid sequence analysis of the affinity-purified proteins was performed by tandem mass spectroscopy. The results unexpectedly demonstrated that in rat mammary cells CArG box-binding factor A (CBF-A) is the major protein species that bind specifically to the rat and human HRE sequences with high affinity. The affinity of CBF-A binding to HRE was significantly higher than to the CArG box described as a recognition sequence for CBF-A protein. Transient transfection assays using reporter plasmids verified that mutations within the HRE that disrupt binding of CBF-A also reduced the activity of the rat Ha-ras promoter. Despite the fact that the HRE within the Ha-ras promoter resembles a binding site for Ets transcription factors, we did not detect the binding of Ets-related proteins to the rat HRE in BICR-M1Rk cells. We further demonstrated a correlation between the presence of HRE binding activity and induction of Ha-ras mRNA expression following serum stimulation in the mammary carcinoma cell line. Taken together, our results suggest that CBF-A may play an important role in transcriptional regulation of Ha-ras promoter activity during normal mammary cell growth and carcinogenesis.",10/1/00,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,3762-70,,19,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Gene Expression Regulation; *Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B; Affinity; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology; Base Sequence; Blotting; Chromatography; Cultured; DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism; DNA/genetics/metabolism; Genes; Genetic/*genetics; High Pressure Liquid; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Messenger/genetics/metabolism; Mimosine/pharmacology; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Weight; Mutation/genetics; Neoplastic/drug effects; Promoter Regions; Protein Binding/drug effects; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets; Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism; ras/*genetics; Rats; Reporter/genetics; Repressor Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism; Response Elements/genetics; RNA; Thermodynamics; Transcription Factors/metabolism; Transfection; Tumor Cells; Ultraviolet Rays; Western,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Samples included 29 histologically verified primary tumors and 23 benign controls. Microarray analysis was initially performed using a sequence verified set of 40,000 human cDNA clones. Among the genes most consistently and highly upregulated in prostate cancers was the ETS family transcription factor ERG (ETS related gene). This finding was validated in an expanded patient series (37 tumors and 38 benign samples) using DNA oligonucleotide microarray and real-time quantitative PCR assays. ERG was 20- to more than 100-fold overexpressed in prostate cancers compared with benign prostate tissue in more than 50% of patients according to quantitative PCR. Surprisingly, ERG mRNA levels were found to be significantly higher in the endothelial cell line, HUVEC, than in the prostate cell lines PC3, DU145 and LNCaP. In situ hybridization of prostate cancers tissue revealed that ERG was abundantly expressed in both prostate cancers cells and associated endothelial cells. The consistency and magnitude of ERG overexpression in prostate cancers appeared unique, but several related ETS transcription factors were also overexpressed in matched pairs of tumor and benign samples, whereas ETS2 was significantly underexpressed.

RESULTS: Using isotope-coded affinity tags and mass spectrometry we identified and quantified the relative abundance levels of 1,064 proteins and found that distinct cellular processes were coregulated by androgen while others were essentially unaffected. Subsequent pharmacological perturbation of the cellular process for energy generation confirmed that androgen starvation had a profound effect on this pathway.

Differential Rank Conservation (DIRAC) is a novel approach for studying gene ordering within pathways and is based on the relative expression ranks of participating genes. DIRAC provides quantitative measures of how pathway rankings differ both within and between phenotypes. DIRAC between pathways in a selected phenotype contrasts the scenarios where either (i) pathways are ranked similarly in all samples; or (ii) the ordering of pathway genes is highly varied. We examined gene expression in GIST and LMS tumor profiles and identified pathways that appear to be tightly regulated based on high conservation of gene ordering. The second form of DIRAC manifests as a change in ranking (i.e., shuffling) between phenotypes for a selected pathway.

CD10 is strongly expressed by normal prostate epithelium. While only 30% of primary prostate tumors express CD10, it is strongly expressed by most lymph node metastases. The function of CD10 and the interaction between CD10 and other cellular proteins in prostate cancers (CaP) is not well defined. Cellular context may ultimately determine its biologic function in CaP. In this study, we compared CD10 mRNA and protein expression between benign and malignant prostate cells and employed proteomic analysis to identify proteins that interact with CD10 in C4-2 prostate cancers cells. METHODS: CD10 mRNA and protein expression was compared using RT-PCR and Western blotting. CD10-protein complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-CD10 monoclonal antibodies. Eluted fractions were combined, trypsinized, and the resulting peptides analyzed by microLC-ESI-MS/MS. The parent proteins were identified by searching MS/MS spectra against a human protein database using SEQUEST. RESULTS: There were no differences in CD10 mRNA length or CD10 protein molecular weight between normal tissue and CaP. We identified 75 proteins unique to or heavily enriched in the CD10 immunoprecipitates by proteomic analysis. The 27 kDa heat shock protein (HSP27) and HSP70 were identified in three separate precipitations. Protein identification by proteomics was confirmed by Western blotting. Protein complexes immunopurified from C4-2 protein extracts using anti-HSP27 and anti-HSP70 antibodies were found to contain CD10.

In this study, we used the mouse bone marrow transplant model to further explore the role of 24p3 in BCR-ABL-induced leukemia. Consistent with our previous findings, when using non-irradiated mice as recipient, donor marrow cells expressing BCR-ABL but lacking 24p3 did not cause leukemia or any disease after 75 days, whereas all mice receiving wild type BCR-ABL donor cells died with CML-like disease. An agar clone of the BCR-ABL+ human CML cell line K562 (C5) that secretes relatively high levels of lipocalin 2 (human NGAL) induced suppression of hematopoiesis in spleen and marrow of mice, leading to early death in contrast to parental K562 or K562 clone (C6) expressing low amounts of NGAL. Compared with K562 cells, overexpressing NGAL in K562 led to a higher apoptosis rate and an atrophy phenotype in the spleen of the inoculated mice. Plasma from both leukemic mice and CML patients showed elevated lipocalin 2 levels compared with healthy individuals. Moreover, we found that a primary stable cell line from wild-type mouse marrow cells expressing BCR-ABL caused solid tumors in nude mice whereas a similar BCR-ABL+ cell line from 24p3 null mice did not.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Observational study of multidimensional genomics and clinical data on 316 high-grade serous ovarian cancers cases that were made public between 2009 and 2010 via The cancers Genome Atlas project. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OS and PFS rates (primary outcomes) and chemotherapy response (secondary outcome). RESULTS: BRCA2 mutations (29 cases) were associated with significantly better OS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.33; 95% CI, 0.16-0.69; P = .003 and 5-year OS, 61% for BRCA2-mutated vs 25% for BRCA wild-type cases) and PFS (adjusted HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.74; P = .004 and 3-year PFS, 44% for BRCA2-mutated vs 16% for BRCA wild-type cases), whereas neither BRCA1 mutations (37 cases) nor BRCA1 methylation (33 cases) was associated with prognosis. Moreover, BRCA2 mutations were associated with a significantly higher primary chemotherapy sensitivity rate (100% for BRCA2-mutated vs 82% [P = .02] and 80% [P = .05] for BRCA wild-type and BRCA1-mutated cases, respectively) and longer platinum-free duration (median platinum-free duration, 18.0 months for BRCA2-mutated vs 11.7 [P = .02] and 12.5 [P = .04] months for BRCA wild-type and BRCA1-mutated cases, respectively).

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A gene expression model that predicts response to chemotherapy is developed and validated using a large-scale data set consisting of 493 samples from The cancers Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 244 samples from an Australian report. An identified 227-gene signature achieves an overall predictive accuracy of greater than 85% with a sensitivity of approximately 95% and specificity of approximately 70%. The gene signature significantly distinguishes between patients with unfavorable versus favorable prognosis, when applied to either an independent data set (P = 0.04) or an external validation set (P<0.0001). In parallel, we present the production of a tumor nuclear image profile generated from 253 sample slides by characterizing patients with nuclear features (such as size, elongation, and roundness) in incremental bins, and we identify a morphologic signature that demonstrates a strong association with chemotherapy response in serous ovarian carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: A gene signature discovered on a large data set provides robustness in accurately predicting chemotherapy response in serous ovarian carcinoma. The combination of the molecular and morphologic signatures yields a new understanding of potential mechanisms involved in drug resistance.",2012,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e36383,,5,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies supporting a role for the HGF pathway in prostate carcinogenesis prompted an analysis of HAI-1 expression in the prostate. Here we analyze the regulation of HAI-1 expression by androgen, oncogenic transformation, and cancers progression. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HAI-1 expression was restricted to prostate epithelium, where staining occurred primarily in basal and atrophic luminal epithelial cells. Compared to normal glands, HAI-1 expression was significantly increased in localized prostate cancers and was present in most prostate cancers metastases. HAI-1 protein expression levels were sensitive to androgen in normal epithelium but not in cancers. Although androgen did not increase HAI-1 protein expression levels in LNCaP cells, it decreased HAI-1 surface expression, consistent with previous data from our group (Martin DB, Gifford DR, Wright ME, Keller A, Yi E, Goodlett DR, Aebersold R, Nelson PS: Quantitative proteomic analysis of proteins released by neoplastic prostate epithelium. cancers Res 2004, 64:347-355).

However, prostate tumors that survive long-term androgen-ablation therapy are classified as androgen-independent as they proliferate in the absence of androgens, and they tend to be enriched for neuroendocrine (NE) cells. Androgen withdrawal causes androgen-dependent prostate cancers cells to adopt a pronounced NE phenotype, suggesting that androgen receptor (AR) represses an intrinsic NE transdifferentiation process in prostate cancers cells. In this report we show that short interfering RNA-induced AR silencing induced a NE phenotype that manifested itself in the growth of dendritic-like processes in both the androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent LNCaP-AI human prostate cancers cells. Western blot analysis revealed that neuronal-specific enolase, a marker of the neuronal lineage, was increased by AR knockdown in LNCaP cells. The expression levels of the neuronal-specific cytoskeletal proteins beta-tubulin III, nestin, and glial acidic fibrillary protein were also characterized in AR knockdown cells. Most interestingly, AR silencing induced beta-tubulin III expression in LNCaP cells, while AR knockdown increased glial acidic fibrillary protein levels in both LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cells. Lastly, AR silencing reduced the proliferative capacity of LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cells. Our data demonstrate that AR actively represses an intrinsic NE transdifferentiation process in androgen-responsive prostate cancers cells and suggest a potential link between AR inactivation and the increased frequency of NE cells in androgen-independent tumors.",2003-09,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,1726-37,,9,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Androgen/genetics/*metabolism; Biological Markers; Carcinoma/metabolism; Cell Differentiation/*physiology; Cultured; Gene Silencing/physiology; Humans; Male; Neurosecretory Systems/*metabolism; Phenotype; Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism; Receptors; RNA; RNA Interference/physiology; Small Interfering; Tumor Cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One approach to reduce disease heterogeneity is to stratify families on the basis of the occurrence of multiple cancers types. This method may increase the power for detecting susceptibility loci, including those with pleiotropic effects. We have completed a genome-wide SNP linkage analysis of 96 HPC families, each of which has one or more first-degree relatives with colon cancers (CCa), and further analyzed the subset of families with two or more CCa cases (n = 27). When only a prostate cancers (PCa) phenotype was considered to be affected, we observed suggestive evidence for linkage (LOD >/=1.86) at 15q14, 18q21 and 19q13 in all families, and at 1p32 and 15q11-q14 in families with two or more CCa cases. When both the PCa and CCa phenotypes were considered affected, suggestive evidence for linkage was observed at 11q25, 15q14 and 18q21 in all families, and at 1q31, 11q14 and 15q11-14 in families with two or more CCa cases. The strongest linkage signal was identified at 15q14 when both PCa and CCa phenotypes were considered to be affected in families with two or more CCa cases (recessive HLOD = 3.88).

We present evidence that ATF3 is induced by TGFbeta in the MCF10CA1a breast cancers cells and plays an integral role for TGFbeta to upregulate its target genes snail, slug and twist, and to enhance cell motility. Furthermore, ATF3 upregulates the expression of the TGFb gene itself, forming a positive-feedback loop for TGFbeta signaling. Functionally, ectopic expression of ATF3 leads to morphological changes and alterations of markers consistent with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It also leads to features associated with breast-cancers-initiating cells: increased CD24(low)-CD44(high) population of cells, mammosphere formation and tumorigenesis. Conversely, knockdown of ATF3 reduces EMT, CD24(low)-CD44(high) cells and mammosphere formation. Importantly, knocking down twist, a downstream target, reduces the ability of ATF3 to enhance mammosphere formation, indicating the functional significance of twist in ATF3 action. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the ability of ATF3 to enhance breast cancers-initiating cell features and to feedback on TGFbeta. Because ATF3 is an adaptive-response gene and is induced by various stromal signals, these findings have significant implications for how the tumor microenvironment might affect cancers development.",10/15/10,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,3558-65,,Pt 20,123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L.",Suggestive genetic linkage to chromosome 11p11.2-q12.2 in hereditary prostate cancer families with primary kidney cancer,The Prostate,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pros.20528,,"BACKGROUND: The Seattle-based PROGRESS study was started in 1995 to ascertain hereditary prostate cancers (HPC) families for studies of genetic susceptibility. Subsequent studies by several research groups, including our own, suggest that HPC is a genetically heterogeneous disease. To be successful in mapping loci for such a complex disease, one must consider ways of grouping families into subsets that likely share the same genetic origin. Towards that end, we analyzed a genome-wide scan of HPC families with primary kidney cancers. METHODS: An 8.1 cM genome-wide scan including 441 microsatellite markers was analyzed by both parametric and non-parametric linkage approaches in fifteen HPC families with the co-occurrence of kidney cancers. RESULTS: There was no evidence for significant linkage in the initial findings. However, two regions of suggestive linkage were observed at 11q12 and 4q21, with HLOD scores of 2.59 and 2.10, respectively. The primary result on chromosome 11 was strengthened after excluding two families with members who had rare transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). Specifically, we observed a non-parametric Kong and Cox P-value of 0.004 for marker D11S1290 at 11p11.2. The 8 cM region between 11p11.2 and 11q12.2 was refined by the addition of 16 new markers. The subset of HPC families with a median age of diagnosis >65 years demonstrated the strongest evidence for linkage, with an HLOD = 2.50. The P-values associated with non-parametric analysis ranged from 0.004 to 0.05 across five contiguous markers.

Each method has certain strengths and weaknesses; however, no comparison has been made between the data derived from Affymetrix arrays and MPSS. In this study, two lineage-related prostate cancers cell lines, LNCaP and C4-2, were used for transcriptome analysis with the aim of identifying genes associated with prostate cancers progression. METHODS: Affymetrix GeneChip array and MPSS analyses were performed. Data was analyzed with GeneSpring 6.2 and in-house perl scripts. Expression array results were verified with RT-PCR. RESULTS: Comparison of the data revealed that both technologies detected genes the other did not. In LNCaP, 3,180 genes were only detected by Affymetrix and 1,169 genes were only detected by MPSS. Similarly, in C4-2, 4,121 genes were only detected by Affymetrix and 1,014 genes were only detected by MPSS. Analysis of the combined transcriptomes identified 66 genes unique to LNCaP cells and 33 genes unique to C4-2 cells. Expression analysis of these genes in prostate cancers specimens showed CA1 to be highly expressed in bone metastasis but not expressed in primary tumor and EPHA7 to be expressed in normal prostate and primary tumor but not bone metastasis. CONCLUSION: Our data indicates that transcriptome profiling with a single methodology will not fully assess the expression of all genes in a cell line. A combination of transcription profiling technologies such as DNA array and MPSS provides a more robust means to assess the expression profile of an RNA sample.

In this large, multi-centered, collaborative study, we performed statistical recombinant mapping in 54 pedigrees selected to be informative for recombinant mapping from nine member groups of the International Consortium for Prostate cancers Genetics (ICPCG). These 54 pedigrees included the 14 extended pedigrees from Utah and 40 pedigrees from eight other ICPCG member groups. The additional 40 pedigrees were selected from a total pool of 1213 such that each pedigree was required to contain both at least four prostate cancers (PRCA) cases and exhibit evidence for linkage to the chromosome 22q region. The recombinant events in these 40 independent pedigrees confirmed the previously proposed region. Further, when all 54 pedigrees were considered, the three-recombinant consensus region was narrowed down by more than a megabase to 2.2 Mb at chromosome 22q12.3 flanked by D22S281 and D22S683. This narrower region eliminated 20 annotated genes from that previously proposed, leaving only 11 genes.

EMT is associated with increased aggressiveness, invasiveness, and metastatic potential in carcinoma cells. To assess the contribution of extracellular vesicles during EMT, we conducted a proteomic analysis of exosomes released from Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and MDCK cells transformed with oncogenic H-Ras (21D1 cells). Exosomes are 40 to 100 nm membranous vesicles originating from the inward budding of late endosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and are released from cells upon fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane. Exosomes from MDCK cells (MDCK Exos) and 21D1 cells (21D1Exos) were purified from cell culture media using density gradient centrifugation (OptiPrep), and protein content identified by GeLC MS/MS proteomic profiling. Both MDCK- and 21D1-Exos populations were morphologically similar by cryoelectron microscopy and contained stereotypical exosomes marker proteins such as TSG101, Alix and CD63. In this study we show that the expression levels of typical EMT hallmark proteins seen in whole cells correlate with those observed in MDCKExos and 21D1Exos; i.e., reduction of characteristic inhibitor of angiogenesis, thrombospondin1 and epithelial markers Ecadherin, and EpCAM, with a concomitant up-regulation of mesenchymal makers such as vimentin. Further, we reveal that 21D1Exos are enriched with several proteases (e.g., MMP1, MMP14, MMP19, ADAM10, ADAMTS1), and integrins (e.g., ITGB1, ITGA3, ITGA6) that have been recently implicated in regulating the tumour microenvironment to promote metastatic progression. A salient finding of this study was the unique presence of key transcriptional regulators (e.g., the master transcriptional regulator YXB1) and core splicing complex components (e.g., SF3B1, SF3B3 and SFRS1) in mesenchymal 21D1Exos. Taken together, our findings reveal that exosomes from Ras-transformed MDCK cells are reprogrammed with factors which may be capable of inducing EMT in recipient cells.",5/3/13,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We then re-reviewed the histopathology of these tumors and realized that some of the cases included in our study were acquired 10 years ago when the diagnosis of gastrointestinal sarcoma was made according to histopathologic criteria alone without immunohistochemistry for c-kit. An experienced pathologist reviewed all of the specimens and this revealed that a number of the GIST cases were classified as LMS in the clinical database. Correction of the histopathologic diagnosis and relabeling of the samples resulted in a much more pronounced separation of GIST and LMS in the MDS analysis. This study underscores the need to re-review histopathology as reclassification occurs. While updating the clinical database may be desired, this is usually impractical. For molecular studies that use archival samples, it is critical to have the archival samples re-reviewed by a pathologist. Further, unsupervised analysis often proves to be a critical quality control step in identifying structural problems that may exist. Finally, MDS analysis further supports that GIST is a distinct type of sarcoma.",2006-04,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,177-82,,2,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Gene Expression Regulation; Biological/genetics/*metabolism; Diagnosis; Differential; Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*diagnosis/genetics; Humans; Leiomyosarcoma/*diagnosis/genetics; Mutation/*genetics; Neoplastic; Prognosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics; Tumor Markers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EMT can be regulated by many signaling pathways and regulatory transcriptional networks. Furthermore, post-transcriptional regulatory networks regulate EMT; these networks include the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) families. Specifically, the miR-200 family, miR-101, miR-506, and several lncRNAs have been found to regulate EMT. Recent studies have illustrated that several lncRNAs are overexpressed in various cancerss and that they can promote tumor metastasis by inducing EMT. MiRNA controls EMT by regulating EMT transcription factors or other EMT regulators, suggesting that lncRNAs and miRNA are novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancers. Further efforts have shown that non-coding-mediated EMT regulation is closely associated with epigenetic regulation through promoter methylation (e.g., miR-200 or miR-506) and protein regulation (e.g., SET8 via miR-502). The formation of gene fusions has also been found to promote EMT in prostate cancers. In this review, we discuss the post-transcriptional regulatory network that is involved in EMT and MET and how targeting EMT and MET may provide effective therapeutics for human disease.",2014,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,19,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drug uptake was increased by insulin co-treatment when cells were grown in methylcellulose and monitored under the microscope, but not when cultured in suspension.

Using HL60 model human myeloid leukemia cells, where all-trans retinoic acid (RA) induces granulocytic differentiation, we developed two emergent RA-resistant HL60 cell lines which are characterized by loss of RA-inducible G1/G0 arrest, CD11b expression, inducible oxidative metabolism and p47(phox) expression. However, RA-treated RA-resistant HL60 continue to exhibit sustained MEK/ERK activation, and one of the two sequentially emergent resistant lines retains RA-inducible CD38 expression. Other signaling events that define the wild-type (WT) response are compromised, including c-Raf phosphorylation and increased expression of c-Cbl, Vav1, and the Src-family kinases (SFKs) Lyn and Fgr.

Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancerss; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities.

Despite significant work on TGCTs and their metastases in humans, absence of a mouse model of spontaneous metastasis has greatly limited our understanding of the mechanisms by which metastatic potential is acquired and on their modes of dissemination. We report a new model of spontaneous TGCT metastasis in the 129 family of mice and provide evidence that these are true metastases derived directly from primary testicular cancerss rather than independently from ectopic stem cells. These putative metastases (pMETs) occur at similar frequencies among TGCT-affected males in six genetically distinct TGCT-susceptible strains and were largely found in anatomical sites that are consistent with patterns of TGCT metastasis in humans. Various lines of evidence support their pluripotency and germ-cell origin, including presence of multiple endodermal, mesodermal and ectodermal derivatives as well as cells showing OCT4 and SSEA-1 pluripotency markers. In addition, pMETs were never found in males that did not have a TGCT, suggesting that metastases are derived from primary tumours. Finally, pMETS and primary TGCTs shared several DNA copy number variants suggesting a common cellular and developmental origin. Together, these results provide the first evidence for spontaneous TGCT metastasis in mice and show that these metastases originate from primary TGCTs rather than independently from ectopic stem cells.",6/9/11,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promoter hypermethylation and histone deacetylation are reversible epigenetic mechanisms associated with transcriptional regulation.

We performed whole-genome microarray analysis to identify genes with altered expression after RNAi-induced suppression of DNMT in a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell line. We then identified genes with both decreased expression and evidence of promoter CpG island hypermethylation in GBM tissue samples using a combined whole-genome microarray transcriptome analysis in conjunction with a promoter array analysis after DNA immunoprecipitation with anti-5-methylcytidine. DNMT1 and 3b knockdown resulted in the restored expression of 308 genes that also contained promoter region hypermethylation. Of these, 43 were also found to be downregulated in GBM tissue samples. Three downregulated genes with hypermethylated promoters and restored expression in response to acute DNMT suppression were assayed for methylation changes using bisulfite sequence analysis of the promoter region after chronic DNMT suppression. Restoration of gene expression was not associated with changes in promoter region methylation, but rather with changes in histone methylation and chromatin conformation.

A widely proposed approach to conquer therapy resistance is to depart from the myopic focus on individual causal pathways and instead target multiple nodes in the cancers cellâ€°Ã›Âªs gene regulatory network. However, most ideas rely on a simplistic conceptualization of networks: utilizing solely their topology and treating it as a display of causal interactions, while ignoring the integrated dynamics in state space. Here, we review the more encompassing formal framework of global network dynamics in which cancers cells, like normal cell types, are high-dimensional attractor states. Then therapy is represented by the network perturbation that will promote the exit from such cancers attractors and reentering a normal attractor. We show in this qualitative and accessible discussion how the idea of a quasi-potential landscape and the theory of least-action-path offer a new formal understanding for computing the set of network nodes (molecular targets) that need to be targeted in concert in order to exit the cancers attractor. But targeting cancers cells based on the network configuration of an ""average"" cancers cell, however precise, may not suffice to eradicate all tumor cells because of the dynamic non-genetic heterogeneity of cancers cell populations that makes them moving targets and drives the replenishment of the cancers attractor with surviving, non-responsive cells from neighboring abnormal attractors.",2013-08,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,270-8,,4,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although most patients initially respond to this treatment, few are cured. Resistance to chemotherapy is the major cause of treatment failure. We applied a quantitative proteomic approach based on ICAT/MS/MS technology to analyze tissues harvested at primary debulking surgery before the initiation of combination chemotherapy in order to identify potential naive or intrinsic chemotherapy response proteins in ovarian cancerss. We identified 44 proteins that are overexpressed, and 34 proteins that are underexpressed in the chemosensitive tissue compared to the chemoresistant tissue. The overexpressed proteins identified in the chemoresistant tissue include 10 proteins (25.6%) belonging to the extracellular matrix (ECM), including decorin, versican, basigin (CD147), fibulin-1, extracellular matrix protein 1, biglycan, fibronectin 1, dermatopontin, alpha-cardiac actin (smooth muscle actin), and an EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1. Interesting proteins identified as overexpressed in the chemosensitive tissue include gamma-catenin (junction plakoglobin) and delta-catenin, tumor suppressor p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), annexin A11, and 53 kDa selenium binding protein 1. Integrative analysis with expression profiling data of eight chemoresistant tissues and 13 chemosensitive tissues revealed that 16 proteins showed consistent changes at both the protein and the RNA levels. These include P53 binding protein 1, catenin delta 1 and plakoglobin, EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1.

We used this system to identify putative AR-binding proteins in the cytosolic and nuclear compartments of mammalian cells using a large scale co-immunoprecipitation strategy coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry. For example, the heat shock 70 and 90 chaperones, which are known regulators of steroid hormone receptor, were identified as AR-binding proteins. AR purification enriched for proteins involved in RNA processing, protein transport, and cytoskeletal organization, suggesting a functional link between AR and these protein modules in mammalian cells. For example, AR purification in the nuclear compartment led to the specific enrichment of alpha-actinin-4, clathrin heavy chain, and serine-threonine protein kinase C delta. Short interfering RNA knockdown studies and co-transcriptional reporter assays revealed that clathrin heavy chain possessed co-activator activity during AR-mediated transcription, whereas alpha-actinin-4 and protein kinase C delta displayed both co-activator and co-repressor activity during AR-mediated transcription that was dependent upon their relative expression levels. Lastly immunohistochemical staining of prostate tissue showed that alpha-actinin-4 levels decreased in the nucleus of high grade cancersous prostate samples, suggesting its possible deregulation in advanced prostate cancerss as previously observed in late stage metastatic breast cancerss. Taken together, these findings suggest AR binds to specific protein modules in mammalian cells and that these protein modules may provide a molecular framework for interrogating AR function in normal and cancersous prostate epithelial cells.",2007-02,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,252-71,,2,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Gene Expression Regulation; Androgen-Binding Protein/*metabolism/physiology; Androgen/*metabolism; Biological; Cell Line; Cluster Analysis; Cytoskeleton/*metabolism/physiology; Endosomes/*metabolism/physiology; Humans; Isotope Labeling/methods; Male; Models; Neoplastic; Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism; Receptors; Signal Transduction; Tumor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we refined this region to a 2.53 Mb interval, using recombination mapping in 42 linked pedigrees.

One major obstacle in the development of diagnostic biomarkers of early pancreatic cancers has been the dual expression of potential biomarkers in both chronic pancreatitis and cancers. To better understand the limitations of potential protein biomarkers, we used ICAT technology and tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics to systematically study protein expression in chronic pancreatitis. Among the 116 differentially expressed proteins identified in chronic pancreatitis, most biological processes were responses to wounding and inflammation, a finding consistent with the underlining inflammation and tissue repair associated with chronic pancreatitis. Furthermore 40% of the differentially expressed proteins identified in chronic pancreatitis have been implicated previously in pancreatic cancers, suggesting some commonality in protein expression between these two diseases. Biological network analysis further identified c-MYC as a common prominent regulatory protein in pancreatic cancers and chronic pancreatitis. Lastly five proteins were selected for validation by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Annexin A2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 were overexpressed in cancers but not in chronic pancreatitis, making them promising biomarker candidates for pancreatic cancers. In addition, our study validated that cathepsin D, integrin beta1, and plasminogen were overexpressed in both pancreatic cancers and chronic pancreatitis.

The effective treatment of pancreatic cancers is critically relying on the diagnosis of the disease at an early stage, which still remains challenging. New experimental approaches, such as quantitative proteomics, have shown great potential for the study of cancers and have opened new opportunities to investigate crucial events underlying pancreatic tumorigenesis and to exploit this knowledge for early detection and better intervention. METHODS: To systematically study protein expression in pancreatic cancers, we used isotope-coded affinity tag technology and tandem mass spectrometry to perform quantitative proteomic profiling of pancreatic cancers tissues and normal pancreas. RESULTS: A total of 656 proteins were identified and quantified in 2 pancreatic cancers samples, of which 151 were differentially expressed in cancers by at least 2-fold. This study revealed numerous proteins that are newly discovered to be associated with pancreatic cancers, providing candidates for future early diagnosis biomarkers and targets for therapy. Several differentially expressed proteins were further validated by tissue microarray immunohistochemistry. Many of the differentially expressed proteins identified are involved in protein-driven interactions between the ductal epithelium and the extracellular matrix that orchestrate tumor growth, migration, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and immunologic escape. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first application of isotope-coded affinity tag technology for proteomic analysis of human cancers tissue and has shown the value of this technology in identifying differentially expressed proteins in cancers.",2005-10,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,1187-97,,4,129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neovascularization; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Pancreatic Neoplasms/blood supply/*genetics/immunology/pathology; Pathologic; Proteome/*genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current Plasma Peptide Atlas provides evidence on which peptides have been detected for every protein confidently identified in plasma; there are links to their spectra and their estimated abundance, facilitating the planning of targeted proteomics for biomarker studies. The Human Proteome Project (HPP) combines a chromosome-centric C-HPP with a biology and disease-driven B/D-HPP, upon a foundation of mass spectrometry, antibody, and knowledgebase resource pillars. The HPP aims to identify the approximately 7000 ""missing proteins"" and to characterize all proteins and their many isoforms. Success will enable the larger research community to utilize newly-available peptides, spectra, informative MS transitions, and databases for targeted analyses of priority proteins for each organ and disease. Among the isoforms of proteins, splice variants have the special feature of greatly enlarging protein diversity without enlarging the genome; evidence is accumulating of striking differential expression of splice variants in cancerss. In this era of RNA-sequencing and advanced mass spectrometry, it is no longer sufficient to speak simply of increased or decreased expression of genes or proteins without carefully examining the splice variants in the protein mixture produced from each multi-exon gene.

Despite high initial response rates, resistance to cisplatin develops in roughly one-third of women during primary treatment and in all women treated for recurrent disease. ICAT coupled with tandem MS is a quantitative proteomic technique for high throughput protein expression profiling of complex protein mixtures. Using ICAT/MS/MS we profiled the nuclear, cytosolic, and microsomal fractions obtained from IGROV-1 [corrected] (cisplatin-sensitive) and IGROV-1/CP [corrected] (cisplatin-resistant) ovarian cancers cell lines. The proteomes of cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancers cells were compared, and protein expression was correlated with mRNA expression profiles. A total of 1117 proteins were identified and quantified. The relative expression of 121 of these varied between the two cell lines. Sixty-three proteins were overexpressed in cisplatin-sensitive, and 58 were over expressed in cisplatin-resistant cells. Examples of proteins at least 5-fold overexpressed in resistant cells and with biological relevance to cancers include cell recognition molecule CASPR3 (13.3-fold), S100 protein family members (8.7-fold), junction adhesion molecule Claudin 4 (7.2-fold), and CDC42-binding protein kinase beta (5.4-fold). Examples of cancers-related proteins at least 5-fold overexpressed in sensitive cells include hepatocyte growth factor inhibitor 1B (13.3-fold) and programmed cell death 6-interacting protein (12.7-fold). The direction of changes in expression levels between proteins and mRNAs were not always in the same direction, possibly reflecting posttranscriptional control of protein expression.

Here we report the isolation and characterization of a new androgen-regulated gene, designated WDR19, that encodes repeating sequence motifs found in the WD-repeat family of proteins. The WD repeat is a conserved domain of approximately 40 amino acids that is typically bracketed by glycine-histidine and tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) dipeptides. WD-repeat proteins are a large group of structurally related proteins that participate in a wide range of cellular functions, including transmembrane signaling, mRNA modification, vesicle formation, and vesicular trafficking. The WDR19 gene comprises 36 exons and is located on chromosome 4p15-4p11. The predicted protein contains six WD repeats, a clathrin heavy-chain repeat, and three transmembrane domains. Sequence analysis reveals that the WDR19 gene is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to human. WDR19 is expressed in normal and neoplastic prostate epithelium as demonstrated by RNA in situ hybridization and is regulated by androgenic hormones. WDR19 transcripts exhibit alternative splicing in which two isoforms appear to be prostate restricted, a property that could be exploited for designing diagnostic or therapeutic strategies for prostate carcinoma.",2003-09,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,331-42,,3,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Alternative Splicing; Amino Acid Sequence; Androgens/ metabolism; Animals; Conserved Sequence; Epithelium/metabolism; Genetic; Humans; Male; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Promoter Regions; Prostate/ metabolism; Proteins/ genetics/ isolation & purification/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred eighty-two proteins were detected in depleted plasma, spanning five orders of magnitude in abundance and reaching below a concentration of 10 ng/ml. The narrower concentration range of proteins in urine allowed the detection of 408 proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that these SRM assays allow reproducible quantification by monitoring 34 biomarker candidates across 83 patient plasma samples. Through public access to the entire assay library, researchers will be able to target their cancers-associated proteins of interest in any sample type using the detectability information in plasma and urine as a guide.

The authors aimed for creation of N-GP effusion profiles from routine cytology specimens to detect relevant biomarkers. METHODS: Hundred microliters of malignant pleural effusions of 5 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 5 nonmalignant controls were used for triplicate N-GP capture by solid-phase extraction. After trypsin digest and PNGase F release, a liquid chromatography separation connected online to a tandem mass spectrometer was performed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). RESULTS: In the total of 10 samples, 170 and 278 nonredundant proteins were detected with probabilities of >or=.9 and >or=.5, respectively. The specificity for the N-glycomotif was 88% at P >or= .9. Penetration into the moderate to low protein concentration range (microg-ng/mL) occurred, and several proteins associated with tumor progression or metastasis were identified, including CA-125, CD44, CD166, lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2 (LAMP-2), multimerin 2, and periostin. MS identifications were correlated with the corresponding immunoreactivity in either effusion fluid or tumor tissue. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, reduction of sample complexity by N-GP capturing allows detection of proteins in the mug to ng/mL range.

PSA is secreted by both normal and neoplastic prostate epithelial cells in response to androgenic hormones and has found widespread use in cancers screening. Because PSA screening is controversial due to sensitivity and specificity issues, efforts continue to focus on the identification and characterization of additional markers that may be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In this study, we report the application of quantitative proteomic techniques that incorporate isotope coded affinity tag reagents and tandem mass spectrometry to comprehensively identify secreted and cell surface proteins from neoplastic prostate epithelium. LNCaP cells, a prostate tumor-derived cell line that secretes PSA in response to androgen exposure, were grown in a low protein-defined media under androgen-stimulated (A+) and -starved (A-) conditions. Proteomic analysis of the media identified in excess of 600 proteins, 524 of which could be quantified. Nine percent of the proteins had A+/A- ratios > 2.0, including PSA, and 2.5% had ratios < 0.5. A subset of these androgen-regulated proteins appeared to be expressed in abundance. Of these, selected mass spectrometry observations were confirmed by Western analysis. The findings suggest that androgen-mediated release of proteins may occur through the activation of proteolytic enzymes rather than exclusively through transcriptional or translational control mechanisms. On the basis of their known functional roles, several of the abundant androgen-regulated proteins may participate in the progression of neoplastic epithelial cell growth and should be considered as potential serum markers of neoplastic prostate diseases.",1/1/04,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,347-55,,1,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Biological/analysis; Cell Line; Conditioned; Culture Media; Enzymes/analysis; Epithelial Cells/chemistry; Humans; Male; Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis; Organelles/chemistry; Prostate-Specific Antigen/analysis; Prostatic Neoplasms/*chemistry; Proteome/*chemistry; Subcellular Fractions/chemistry; Tumor; Tumor Markers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incorporating these new members, we determined mSWI/SNF subunit mutation frequency in exome and whole-genome sequencing studies of primary human tumors. Notably, mSWI/SNF subunits are mutated in 19.6% of all human tumors reported in 44 studies. Our analysis suggests that specific subunits protect against cancers in specific tissues. In addition, mutations affecting more than one subunit, defined here as compound heterozygosity, are prevalent in certain cancerss. Our studies demonstrate that mSWI/SNF is the most frequently mutated chromatin-regulatory complex (CRC) in human cancers, exhibiting a broad mutation pattern, similar to that of TP53.

Such culture of proximate explanation that uses qualitative arguments, simple arrow-arrow schemes or metaphors persists despite the ceaseless accumulation of 'omics' data and the rise of systems biology that now offers precise conceptual tools to explain emergent cell behaviours from gene networks. To facilitate the embrace of the principles of physics and mathematics that underlie such systems and help to bridge the gap between the formal description of theorists and the intuition of experimental biologists, we discuss in qualitative terms three perspectives outside the realm of their familiar linear-deterministic view: (i) state space (ii), high-dimensionality and (iii) heterogeneity.

Using mutants of Myo2p specifically impaired in peroxisome binding, we dissect cell cycle-dependent and peroxisome partitioning-dependent mechanisms of Inp2p regulation. We find that although total Inp2p levels oscillate with the cell cycle, Inp2p levels on individual peroxisomes are controlled by peroxisome inheritance, as Inp2p aberrantly accumulates and decorates all peroxisomes in mother cells when peroxisome partitioning is abolished. We also find that Inp2p is a phosphoprotein whose level of phosphorylation is coupled to the cell cycle irrespective of peroxisome positioning in the cell.

CCR6 expression in Th17 cells is regulated by TGF-beta and requires two nuclear receptors, RORalpha and RORgamma. Th17 cells also express the CCR6 ligand CCL20, which is induced synergistically by TGF-beta and IL-6, which requires STAT3, RORgamma and IL-21. Th17 cells, by producing CCL20, promote migration of Th17 and Treg cells in vitro in a CCR6-dependent manner. Lack of CCR6 in Th17 cells reduces the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Th17 and Treg recruitment into inflammatory tissues.

Linear programming and uniform random sampling were applied herein to identify candidate steady states of the metabolic network that were consistent with the imposed physico-chemical constraints and available experimental data. The activity of the mitochondrion was studied under four metabolic conditions: normal physiologic, diabetic, ischemic, and dietetic. Pairwise correlations between steady-state reaction fluxes were calculated in each condition to evaluate the dependence among the reactions in the network. Applying constraints on exchange fluxes resulted in predictions for intracellular fluxes that agreed with experimental data. Analyses of the steady-state flux distributions showed that the experimentally observed reduced activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in vivo could be a result of stoichiometric constraints and therefore would not necessarily require enzymatic inhibition. The observed changes in the energy metabolism of the mitochondrion under diabetic conditions were used to evaluate the impact of previously suggested treatments. The results showed that neither normalized glucose uptake nor decreased ketone body uptake have a positive effect on the mitochondrial energy metabolism or network flexibility. Taken together, this study showed that sampling of the steady-state flux space is a powerful method to investigate network properties under different conditions and provides a basis for in silico evaluations of effects of potential disease treatments.",3/25/05,2/8/16 23:45,2/9/16 0:19,,11683-11695,,12,280,,The Journal of Biological Chemistry,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,"Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus/*metabolism; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Ischemia/*metabolism; Mitochondria, Heart/*metabolism; Oxygen Consumption",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complex networks of regulatory genetic interactions control developmental cell specification and fates. Development in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, has been studied extensively and large amounts of experimental data, including information on spatial and temporal gene expression patterns, are available. A wide variety of maternal and zygotic regulatory factors and signaling pathways have been discovered in zebrafish, and these provide a useful starting point for reconstructing the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlying development. In this review, we describe in detail the genetic regulatory subcircuits responsible for dorsoanterior-ventroposterior patterning and endoderm formation. We describe a number of regulatory motifs, which appear to act as the functional building blocks of the GRNs. Different positive feedback loops drive the ventral and dorsal specification processes. Mutual exclusivity in dorsal-ventral polarity in zebrafish is governed by intra-cellular cross-inhibiting GRN motifs, including vent/dharma and tll1/chordin. The dorsal-ventral axis seems to be determined by competition between two maternally driven positive-feedback loops (one operating on Dharma, the other on Bmp). This is the first systematic approach aimed at developing an integrated model of the GRNs underlying zebrafish development.

To harness the capabilities of these organisms, we need a comprehensive systems-level understanding of their metabolism, which can be fundamentally achieved through large-scale mechanistic models of metabolism. In this study, we present a revised and significantly improved genome-scale metabolic model for the widely-studied microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The model, iCre1355, represents a major advance over previous models, both in content and predictive power. iCre1355 encompasses a broad range of metabolic functions encoded across the nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes accounting for 1355 genes (1460 transcripts), 2394 and 1133 metabolites. We found improved performance over the previous metabolic model based on comparisons of predictive accuracy across 306 phenotypes (from 81 mutants), lipid yield analysis and growth rates derived from chemostat-grown cells (under three conditions). Measurement of macronutrient uptake revealed carbon and phosphate to be good predictors of growth rate, while nitrogen consumption appeared to be in excess. We analyzed high-resolution time series transcriptomics data using iCre1355 to uncover dynamic pathway-level changes that occur in response to nitrogen starvation and changes in light intensity. This approach enabled accurate prediction of growth rates, the cessation of growth and accumulation of triacylglycerols during nitrogen starvation, and the temporal response of different growth-associated pathways to increased light intensity. Thus, iCre1355 represents an experimentally validated genome-scale reconstruction of C. reinhardtii metabolism that should serve as a useful resource for studying the metabolic processes of this and related microalgae.",2015-12,2/8/16 18:55,2/9/16 0:19,,1239-56,,,84,,Plant J,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,"<p>Imam, Saheed<br/>Schauble, Sascha<br/>Valenzuela, Jacob<br/>Lopez Garcia de Lomana, Adrian<br/>Carter, Warren<br/>Price, Nathan D<br/>Baliga, Nitin S<br/>P50 GM076547/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/<br/>England<br/>Plant J. 2015 Dec;84(6):1239-56. doi: 10.1111/tpj.13059.

The expression of genes required for peroxisome assembly and function is controlled by a transcriptional regulatory network that is induced by FAs such as oleate. The core FA-responsive transcriptional network consists of carbon source-sensing transcription factors that regulate key target genes through an overlapping feed-forward network motif (OFFNM). However, a systems-level understanding of the function of this network architecture in regulating dynamic FA-induced gene expression is lacking. The specific role of the OFFNM in regulating the dynamic and cell-population transcriptional response to oleate was investigated using a kinetic model comprised of four core transcription factor genes (ADR1, OAF1, PIP2, and OAF3) and two reporter genes (CTA1 and POT1) that are indicative of peroxisome induction. Simulations of the model suggest that 1), the intrinsic Adr1p-driven feed-forward loop reduces the steady-state expression variability of target genes; 2), the parallel Oaf3p-driven inhibitory feed-forward loop modulates the dynamic response of target genes to a transiently varying oleate concentration; and 3), heterodimerization of Oaf1p and Pip2p does not appear to have a noise-reducing function in the context of oleate-dependent expression of target genes.

Using genetic targeting of BMPR1A in mice, we show that inactivation of BMP signaling results in multiple polyps due to an increased number of crypts and stem cells, accompanied by enhanced Wnt signaling in all proliferating intestine cells. However the increased transcriptional activity of Wnt effecter protein, beta-catenin, is found primarily in intestine stem cells (ISCs). Concurrently, PTEN, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt pathway, is also primarily inactivated in the ISCs, leading to activation of Akt. Thus, Akt may contribute to activation of beta-catenin in ISCs in coordination with Wnt signaling. By conducting a proteomic analysis of the beta-catenin complex, we show that 14-3-3zeta exists in the beta-catenin complex and facilitates activation of beta-catenin by Akt, which, intriguingly, appears to be predominantly in ISCs. Thus, we propose that BMP signaling plays a role in inhibition of ISC self-renewal through suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in ISC, and this cross-talk is bridged, at least in part, through the PTEN/Akt pathway and further enforced by 14-3-3zeta.",2005-02,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,215-6,,2,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/ physiology; 14-3-3 Proteins/analysis/ physiology; Animals; beta Catenin/analysis/genetics/physiology; Biological; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/ physiology; Cell Communication/genetics; Cell Proliferation; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic; Intestines/cytology/physiology; Mice; Models; Oncogene Protein v-akt/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/ physiology; PTEN Phosphohydrolase/analysis/genetics/physiology; Signal Transduction; Stem Cells/chemistry/cytology; Transcription; Wnt Proteins/ physiology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Knowledge of the cargoes carried by each karyopherin and insight into the mechanisms of transport are fundamental to understanding constitutive and regulated transport and elucidating how they impact normal cellular functions. Here, we have focused on the identification of nuclear import cargoes for the essential yeast beta-karyopherin, Kap121p. Using an overlay blot assay and coimmunopurification studies, we have identified 30 putative Kap121p cargoes. Among these were Nop1p and Sof1p, two essential trans-acting protein factors required at the early stages of ribosome biogenesis. Characterization of the Kap121p-Nop1p and Kap121p-Sof1p interactions demonstrated that, in addition to lysine-rich nuclear localization signals (NLSs), Kap121p recognizes a unique class of signals distinguished by the abundance of arginine and glycine residues and consequently termed rg-NLSs. Kap104p is also known to recognize rg-NLSs, and here we show that it compensates for the loss of Kap121p function. Sof1p is also transported by Kap121p; however, its import can be mediated by a piggyback mechanism with Nop1p bridging the interaction between Sof1p and Kap121p. Together, our data elucidate additional levels of complexity in these nuclear transport pathways.",2004-10,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,8487-503,,19,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Cell Nucleus/*metabolism; Karyopherins/*metabolism; Molecular Sequence Data; Nuclear Localization Signals/metabolism; Nuclear Proteins/metabolism; Phosphoproteins/metabolism; Protein Interaction Mapping; Proteins/*metabolism; Protein Transport/*physiology; Ribonucleoproteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/metabolism; Small Nuclear/metabolism; Small Nucleolar/metabolism; Yeasts/genetics/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we examine whether the signal from Toll-like receptors [TLRs] is sustained for as long as the ligand is present, and whether responses to different TLR agonists are additive. RESULTS: RAW264 macrophage cells were doubly-transfected with reporter genes in which the IL-12p40, ELAM or IL-6 promoter controls firefly luciferase, and the human IL-1beta promoter drives renilla luciferase. The resultant stable lines provide robust assays of macrophage activation by TLR stimuli including LPS [TLR4], lipopeptide [TLR2], and bacterial DNA [TLR9], with each promoter demonstrating its own intrinsic characteristics. With each of the promoters, luciferase activity was induced over an 8 hr period, and thereafter reached a new steady state. Elevated expression required the continued presence of agonist. Sustained responses to different classes of agonist were perfectly additive. This pattern was confirmed by measuring inducible cytokine production in the same cells. While homodimerization of TLR4 mediates responses to LPS, TLR2 appears to require heterodimerization with another receptor such as TLR6. Transient expression of constitutively active forms of TLR4 or TLR2 plus TLR6 stimulated IL-12 promoter activity. The effect of LPS, a TLR4 agonist, was additive with that of TLR2/6 but not TLR4, whilst that of lipopeptide, a TLR2 agonist, was additive with TLR4 but not TLR2/6. Actions of bacterial DNA were additive with either TLR4 or TLR2/6. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that maximal activation by any one TLR pathway does not preclude further activation by another, suggesting that common downstream regulatory components are not limiting. Upon exposure to a TLR agonist, macrophages enter a state of sustained activation in which they continuously sense the presence of a microbial challenge.",2001,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,11,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Macrophage Activation; Animals; Cell Line; Cells; Cell Surface/*agonists/metabolism; Cultured; Cytokines/biosynthesis; Dose-Response Relationship; Drug; Genes; Inbred BALB C; Kinetics; Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology; Luciferases/genetics/metabolism; Macrophages/drug effects/*immunology; Membrane Glycoproteins/*agonists/metabolism; Mice; Receptors; Reporter; Toll-Like Receptor 2; Toll-Like Receptor 4; Toll-Like Receptors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of profiles in disease vs normal conditions provides insights into the processes underlying disease progression. However, availability and integration of public gene expression datasets remains a major challenge. The aim of the present study was to explore the transcriptome of pancreatic islets and, based on this information, to prepare a comprehensive and open access inventory of insulin-producing beta cell gene expression, the Beta Cell Gene Atlas (BCGA). METHODS: We performed Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) analysis of human pancreatic islet samples and microarray analyses of purified rat beta cells, alpha cells and INS-1 cells, and compared the information with available array data in the literature. RESULTS: MPSS analysis detected around 7600 mRNA transcripts, of which around a third were of low abundance. We identified 2000 and 1400 transcripts that are enriched/depleted in beta cells compared to alpha cells and INS-1 cells, respectively. Microarray analysis identified around 200 transcription factors that are differentially expressed in either beta or alpha cells. We reanalyzed publicly available gene expression data and integrated these results with the new data from this study to build the BCGA. The BCGA contains basal (untreated conditions) gene expression level estimates in beta cells as well as in different cell types in human, rat and mouse pancreas. Hierarchical clustering of expression profile estimates classify cell types based on species while beta cells were clustered together. CONCLUSION: Our gene atlas is a valuable source for detailed information on the gene expression distribution in beta cells and pancreatic islets along with insulin producing cell lines. The BCGA tool, as well as the data and code used to generate the Atlas are available at the T1Dbase website (T1DBase.org).",2009,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,3,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that septin sumoylation is controlled by the interactions of two enzymes of the sumoylation pathway, Siz1p and Ulp1p, with the nuclear transport machinery. The E3 ligase Siz1p is imported into the nucleus by the karyopherin Kap95p during interphase. In M phase, Siz1p is exported from the nucleus by the karyopherin Kap142p/Msn5p and subsequently targeted to the septin ring, where it participates in septin sumoylation. We also show that the accumulation of sumoylated septins during mitosis is dependent on the interactions of the SUMO isopeptidase Ulp1p with Kap121p and Kap95p-Kap60p and the nuclear pore complex (NPC). In addition to sequestering Ulp1 at the NPC, Kap121p is required for targeting Ulp1p to the septin ring during mitosis.

For example, defining the timing, magnitude and the coordination of cytokine responses in single cells is critical for understanding the development of effective immunity. While approaches to measure gene expression from single cells have been reported, the absolute performance of these techniques has been difficult to assess, which likely has limited their wider application. We describe a straightforward method for simultaneously measuring the expression of multiple genes in a multitude of single-cell samples using flow cytometry, parallel cDNA synthesis, and quantification by real-time PCR. We thoroughly assess the performance of the technique using mRNA and DNA standards and cell samples, and demonstrate a detection sensitivity of approximately 30 mRNA molecules per cell, and a fractional error of 15%. Using this method, we expose unexpected heterogeneity in the expression of 5 immune-related genes in sets of single macrophages activated by different microbial stimuli. Further, our analyses reveal that the expression of one â€°Ã›Âªpro-inflammatoryâ€°Ã›Âª cytokine is not predictive of the expression of another â€°Ã›Âªpro-inflammatoryâ€°Ã›Âª cytokine within the same cell.

We have developed a systems biology approach to the identification of promising beta cell markers. METHODS: We followed a functional genomics strategy based on massive parallel signal sequencing (MPSS) and microarray data obtained in human islets, purified primary rat beta cells, non-beta cells and INS-1E cells to identify promising beta cell markers. Candidate biomarkers were validated and screened using established human and macaque (Macacus cynomolgus) tissue microarrays. RESULTS: After a series of filtering steps, 12 beta cell-specific membrane proteins were identified. For four of the proteins we selected or produced antibodies targeting specifically the human proteins and their splice variants; all four candidates were confirmed as islet-specific in human pancreas. Two splice variants of FXYD domain containing ion transport regulator 2 (FXYD2), a regulating subunit of the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, were identified as preferentially present in human pancreatic islets. The presence of FXYD2gammaa was restricted to pancreatic islets and selectively detected in pancreatic beta cells. Analysis of human fetal pancreas samples showed the presence of FXYD2gammaa at an early stage (15 weeks). Histological examination of pancreatic sections from individuals with type 1 diabetes or sections from pancreases of streptozotocin-treated Macacus cynomolgus monkeys indicated a close correlation between loss of FXYD2gammaa and loss of insulin-positive cells.

Despite pleiotropic effects on cells, the role of these epoxyeicosanoids in normal organ and tissue regeneration remains unknown. EETs are produced predominantly in the endothelium. Normal organ and tissue regeneration require an active paracrine role of the microvascular endothelium, which in turn depends on angiogenic growth factors. Thus, we hypothesize that endothelial cells stimulate organ and tissue regeneration via production of bioactive EETs. To determine whether endothelial-derived EETs affect physiologic tissue growth in vivo, we used genetic and pharmacological tools to manipulate endogenous EET levels. We show that endothelial-derived EETs play a critical role in accelerating tissue growth in vivo, including liver regeneration, kidney compensatory growth, lung compensatory growth, wound healing, corneal neovascularization, and retinal vascularization. Administration of synthetic EETs recapitulated these results, whereas lowering EET levels, either genetically or pharmacologically, delayed tissue regeneration, demonstrating that pharmacological modulation of EETs can affect normal organ and tissue growth. We also show that soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors, which elevate endogenous EET levels, promote liver and lung regeneration.

The first study of genome-scale extreme pathways for the simultaneous formation of all nonessential amino acids or ribonucleotides in Helicobacter pylori is presented. Three key results were obtained. First, the extreme pathways for the production of individual amino acids in H. pylori showed far fewer internal states per external state than previously found in Haemophilus influenzae, indicating a more rigid metabolic network. Second, the degree of pathway redundancy in H. pylori was essentially the same for the production of individual amino acids and linked amino acid sets, but was approximately twice that of the production of the ribonucleotides. Third, the metabolic network of H. pylori was unable to achieve extensive conversion of amino acids consumed to the set of either nonessential amino acids or ribonucleotides and thus diverted a large portion of its nitrogen to ammonia production, a potentially important result for pH regulation in its acidic habitat.

A survival outcome is easy to achieve when lethal injury is close to the tipping point, but becomes progressively difficult as injury magnitudes increase, and there is an upper limit to salvageable injuries.

Here, we highlight the potential for self-organization to contribute to stem cell fate computation. A new way of considering regulatory circuitry is presented that describes the expression of each transcription factor (TF) as a branching process that propagates through time, interacting and competing with others. In a single cell, the interactions between multiple branching processes generate a collective process called â€°Ã›Âªcritical-like self-organizationâ€°Ã›Âª. We explain how this phenomenon provides a valid description of whole genome regulatory circuit dynamics. The hypothesis of exploratory stem cell decision-making proposes that critical-like self-organization (also called rapid self-organized criticality) provides the backbone for cell fate computation in regulative embryos and pluripotent stem cells. Unspecific amplification of TF expression is predicted to initiate this self-organizing circuitry, where cascades of gene expression propagate and may interact either synergistically or antagonistically. The emergent and highly dynamic circuitry is affected by various sources of selection pressure, such as the expression of TFs with disproportionate influence over other genes, and extrinsic biological and physical stimuli that differentially modulate particular gene expression cascades. Extrinsic conditions continuously trigger waves of transcription that ripple throughout regulatory networks on multiple spatiotemporal scales, providing the context within which circuitry self-organizes. In this framework, a distinction between instructive and selective mechanisms of fate determination is misleading because it is the â€°Ã›Âªinterference patternâ€°Ã›Âª, rather than any single instructing or selecting factor, that is ultimately responsible for computing and directing cell fate. Using this framework, we consider whether the idea of a naÃŒÃ¸ve ground state of pluripotency and that of a fluctuating transcriptome are compatible, and whether a ground state like that captured in vitro could exist in vivo.",2012-03,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,324-33,,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Biological; Cell Lineage; Embryonic Stem Cells; Mice; Models; Pluripotent Stem Cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We address this fundamental problem in a class of model systems by developing a general mathematical framework that allows the calculation of mesoscopic properties from the knowledge of microscopic Markovian transition probabilities. We show how exact analytic formulae for the first and second moments of resident time distributions in mesostates can be derived from microscopic resident times and transition probabilities even for systems with a large number of microstates. We apply our formalism to models of the inositol trisphosphate receptor, which plays a key role in generating calcium signals triggering a wide variety of cellular responses. We demonstrate how experimentally accessible quantities, such as opening and closing times and the coefficient of variation of inter-spike intervals, and other, more elaborated, quantities can be analytically calculated from the underlying microscopic Markovian dynamics. A virtue of our approach is that we do not need to follow the detailed time evolution of the whole system, as we derive the relevant properties of its steady state without having to take into account the often extremely complicated transient features. We emphasize that our formulae fully agree with results obtained by stochastic simulations and approaches based on a full determination of the microscopic systemâ€°Ã›Âªs time evolution. We also illustrate how experiments can be devised to discriminate between alternative molecular models of the inositol trisphosphate receptor. The developed approach is applicable to any system described by a Markov process and, owing to the analytic nature of the resulting formulae, provides an easy way to characterize also rare events that are of particular importance to understand the intermittency properties of complex dynamic systems.",2/21/14,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:47,,102-12,,,343,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand why this motif is so prevalent, we examined its properties in an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulatory network in yeast (Oaf1p/Pip2p). We demonstrate that the asymmetry in positive feedback confers a competitive advantage and allows the system to robustly increase its responsiveness while precisely tuning the response to a consistent level in the presence of varying stimuli.

Here, we show that Gpd1p is directed to peroxisomes by virtue of an N-terminal type 2 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS2) in a Pex7p-dependent manner. Significantly, localization of Gpd1p to peroxisomes is dependent on the metabolic status of cells and the phosphorylation of aminoacyl residues adjacent to the targeting signal. Exposure of cells to osmotic stress induces changes in the subcellular distribution of Gpd1p to the cytosol and nucleus. This behavior is similar to Pnc1p, which is coordinately expressed with Gpd1p, and under conditions of cell stress changes its subcellular distribution from peroxisomes to the nucleus where it mediates chromatin silencing. Although peroxisomes are necessary for the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in yeast, the localization of Gpd1p to peroxisomes is not. Rather, shifts in the distribution of Gpd1p to different cellular compartments in response to changing cellular status suggests a role for Gpd1p in the spatial regulation of redox potential, a process critical to cell survival, especially under the complex stress conditions expected to occur in the wild.",2/26/10,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,6739-49,,9,285,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lipopeptides are present in a wide variety of microbes and stimulate immune responses through TLR1/2 or TLR2/6 heterodimers. It is not currently known whether polymorphisms in TLR1 regulate the innate immune response. We stimulated human whole blood with triacylated lipopeptide, a ligand for TLR1/2 heterodimers, and found substantial inter-individual variation in the immune response. We sequenced the coding region of TLR1 and found a non-synonymous polymorphism, I602S (base pair T1805G), that regulated signalling. In comparison to TLR1_602S, the 602I variant mediated substantially greater basal and lipopeptide-induced NF-kappaB signalling in transfected HEK293 cells. These signalling differences among TLR1 variants were also found with stimulation by extracts of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Furthermore, individuals with the 602II genotype produced substantially more IL-6 than those with the 602SS variant in a lipopeptide-stimulated whole-blood cytokine assay. Together, these observations demonstrate that variation in the inflammatory response to bacterial lipopeptides is regulated by a common TLR1 transmembrane domain polymorphism that could potentially impact the innate immune response and clinical susceptibility to a wide spectrum of pathogens.",2007-08,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,2280-9,,8,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Immunity; Bacterial Proteins/*immunology; Base Sequence; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Humans; Immunoblotting; Innate; Lipoproteins/*immunology; Mycobacterium tuberculosis/immunology; NF-kappa B; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism; Single Nucleotide; Toll-Like Receptor 1/*genetics; Transfection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fermentation process typically proceeds in two phases (acidogenic and solventogenic) in a batch mode. Poor solvent resistance by the solventogenic clostridia and other fermenting microorganisms is a major limiting factor in the profitability of ABE production by fermentation. The toxic effect of solvents, especially butanol, limits the concentration of these solvents in the fermentation broth, limiting solvent yields and adding to the cost of solvent recovery from dilute solutions. The accepted dogma is that toxicity in the ABE fermentation is due to chaotropic effects of butanol on the cell membranes of the fermenting microorganisms, which poses a challenge for the biotechnological whole-cell bio-production of butanol. This mini-review is focused on (1) the effects of solvents on inhibition of cell metabolism (nutrient transport, ion transport, and energy metabolism); (2) cell membrane fluidity, death, and solvent tolerance associated with the ability of cells to tolerate high concentrations of solvents without significant loss of cell function; and (3) strategies for overcoming poor solvent resistance in acetone and butanol-producing microorganisms.",2010-02,2/8/16 23:58,2/9/16 0:19,,1697-1712,,6,85,,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,*Biotechnology; *Fermentation; Acetone/*metabolism; Butanols/*metabolism; Cell Membrane/metabolism; Clostridium/genetics/growth & development/*metabolism; Membrane Fluidity/genetics; Solvents/*metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we apply cross-linking/mass spectrometry and structural modelling to determine the molecular architecture of the Dam1 complex. We find microtubule attachment is accompanied by substantial conformational changes, with direct binding mediated by the carboxy termini of Dam1p and Duo1p. Aurora B phosphorylation of Dam1p C terminus weakens direct interaction with the microtubule. Furthermore, the Dam1p amino terminus forms an interaction interface between Dam1 complexes, which is also disrupted by phosphorylation.

Biochemical characterization of individual karyopherins has led to the identification of many of their cargoes and to the elucidation of the mechanisms by which they mediate transport. Likewise, the characterization of numerous NPC-associated components, in combination with structural studies of NPCs, have begun to address the possible mechanisms that drive nucleocytoplasmic transport, and the role that different nucleoporins play in the transport process. Some recent studies indicate that several NPC-associated factors, previously thought to be stable components of the NPC, dynamically interact with both nuclear and cytoplasmic aspects of the NPC.

This structure allows the drug to bind the ribosomal A site and incorporate into nascent polypeptides, causing chain termination, ribosomal subunit dissociation and widespread translational arrest at high concentrations. In contrast, at sufficiently low concentrations, puromycin incorporates primarily at the C-terminus of proteins. While a number of techniques utilize puromycin incorporation as a tool for probing translational activity in vivo, these methods cannot be applied in yeasts that are insensitive to puromycin. Here, we describe a mutant strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is sensitive to puromycin and characterize the cellular response to the drug. Puromycin inhibits the growth of yeast cells mutant for erg6, pdr1 and pdr3 (EPP) on both solid and liquid media. Puromycin also induces the aggregation of the cytoplasmic processing body component Edc3 in the mutant strain. We establish that puromycin is rapidly incorporated into yeast proteins and test the effects of puromycin on translation in vivo. This study establishes the EPP strain as a valuable tool for implementing puromycin-based assays in yeast, which will enable new avenues of inquiry into protein production and maturation.

Frataxin is a critical protein for Fe-S cluster assembly in mitochondria, interacting with other components of the Fe-S cluster machinery, including cysteine desulfurase Nfs1, Isd11 and the Isu1 scaffold protein. Yeast Isu1 with the methionine to isoleucine substitution (M141I), in which the E. coli amino acid is inserted at this position, corrected most of the phenotypes that result from lack of Yfh1 in yeast. This suppressor Isu1 behaved as a genetic dominant. Furthermore frataxin-bypass activity required a completely functional Nfs1 and correlated with the presence of efficient scaffold function. A screen of random Isu1 mutations for frataxin-bypass activity identified only M141 substitutions, including Ile, Cys, Leu, or Val. In each case, mitochondrial Nfs1 persulfide formation was enhanced, and mitochondrial Fe-S cluster assembly was improved in the absence of frataxin. Direct targeting of the entire E. coli IscU to â€°Ã¶Â yfh1 mitochondria also ameliorated the mutant phenotypes. In contrast, expression of IscU with the reverse substitution i.e. IscU with Ile to Met change led to worsening of the â€°Ã¶Â yfh1 phenotypes, including severely compromised growth, increased sensitivity to oxygen, deficiency in Fe-S clusters and heme, and impaired iron homeostasis. A bioinformatic survey of eukaryotic Isu1/prokaryotic IscU database entries sorted on the amino acid utilized at the M141 position identified unique groupings, with virtually all of the eukaryotic scaffolds using Met, and the preponderance of prokaryotic scaffolds using other amino acids. The frataxin-bypassing amino acids Cys, Ile, Leu, or Val, were found predominantly in prokaryotes. This amino acid position 141 is unique in Isu1, and the frataxin-bypass effect likely mimics a conserved and ancient feature of the prokaryotic Fe-S cluster assembly machinery.",2015-05,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e1005135,,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify the major forms of Mediator in yeast, Mediator was isolated from nuclear extracts using a two-step chromatographic procedure, avoiding ion exchange chromatography and high salt conditions to prevent dissociation of subunits during purification.

Although this response has been extensively studied, an in depth understanding of the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) that controls the transition into lipid accumulation remains elusive. In this study, we used a systems biology approach to elucidate the transcriptional program that coordinates the nitrogen starvation-induced metabolic readjustments that drive lipid accumulation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. RESULTS: We demonstrate that nitrogen starvation triggered differential regulation of 2147 transcripts, which were co-regulated in 215 distinct modules and temporally ordered as 31 transcriptional waves. An early-stage response was triggered within 12 min that initiated growth arrest through activation of key signaling pathways, while simultaneously preparing the intracellular environment for later stages by modulating transport processes and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Subsequently, central metabolism and carbon fixation were remodeled to trigger the accumulation of triacylglycerols. Further analysis revealed that these waves of genome-wide transcriptional events were coordinated by a regulatory program orchestrated by at least 17 transcriptional regulators, many of which had not been previously implicated in this process. We demonstrate that the TRN coordinates transcriptional downregulation of 57 metabolic enzymes across a period of nearly 4 h to drive an increase in lipid content per unit biomass. Notably, this TRN appears to also drive lipid accumulation during sulfur starvation, while phosphorus starvation induces a different regulatory program. The TRN model described here is available as a community-wide web-resource at http://networks.systemsbiology.net/chlamy-portal. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we have uncovered a comprehensive mechanistic model of the TRN controlling the transition from N starvation to lipid accumulation. The program coordinates sequentially ordered transcriptional waves that simultaneously arrest growth and lead to lipid accumulation.

We report here that, although amphiphysin IIm is usually only transiently associated with the phagosome, it is indefinitely retained on vacuoles containing C. pneumoniae.

These changes allow a transport inhibitory nucleoporin, Nup53p, to bind the karyopherin Kap121p specifically during mitosis, slowing its movement through the NPC and inducing cargo release.

Thus, a systems level view is necessary for understanding how a cell coordinates this process and for developing effective therapeutic strategies to treat diseases, such as cancers, in which differentiation plays a significant role. Theoretical considerations and recent experimental evidence support the view that cell fates are high dimensional attractor states of the underlying molecular networks. The temporal behavior of the network states progressing toward different cell fate attractors has the potential to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms governing differentiation. RESULTS: Using the HL60 multipotent promyelocytic leukemia cell line, we performed experiments that ultimately led to two different cell fate attractors by two treatments of varying dosage and duration of the differentiation agent all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). The dosage and duration combinations of the two treatments were chosen by means of flow cytometric measurements of CD11b, a well-known early differentiation marker, such that they generated two intermediate populations that were poised at the apparently same stage of differentiation. However, the population of one treatment proceeded toward the terminally differentiated neutrophil attractor while that of the other treatment reverted back toward the undifferentiated promyelocytic attractor. We monitored the gene expression changes in the two populations after their respective treatments over a period of five days and identified a set of genes that diverged in their expression, a subset of which promotes neutrophil differentiation while the other represses cell cycle progression. By employing promoter based transcription factor binding site analysis, we found enrichment in the set of divergent genes, of transcription factors functionally linked to tumor progression, cell cycle, and development. CONCLUSION: Since many of the transcription factors identified by this approach are also known to be implicated in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemia, this study points to the utility of incorporating a dynamical systems level view into a computational analysis framework for elucidating transcriptional mechanisms regulating differentiation.",2009,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,20,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Antigens; Binding Sites/genetics; CD11b/metabolism; Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology; Computational Biology/methods; Flow Cytometry; Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology; Genetic/genetics; HL-60 Cells; Humans; Microarray Analysis; Neutrophils/*cytology/drug effects; Promoter Regions; Tretinoin/pharmacology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to this model, upon oxygen influx, an initial burst of protein synthesis precedes ATP and transcription induction, rapidly driving the cell out of anoxic quiescence, culminating in the resumption of growth. This model also suggests that quiescent cells appear to remain actively poised for energy production from a variety of different sources.

To overcome these limitations, we developed a regression approach to correct for variability in fluorescence intensity due to differences in cell size and granularity without discarding any of the cells, which gating ipso facto does. This approach enables quantitative studies of cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional noise in high-throughput experiments involving thousands of samples.

This technique, however, has a number of drawbacks such as the limited number of available fluorescent channels in microscopes, overlapping excitation and emission spectra of the stains, and phototoxicity. METHODOLOGY: We here present and validate a method to automatically detect cell population outlines directly from bright field images. By imaging samples with several focus levels forming a bright field -stack, and by measuring the intensity variations of this stack over the -dimension, we construct a new two dimensional projection image of increased contrast. With additional information for locations of each cell, such as stained nuclei, this bright field projection image can be used instead of whole cell fluorescence to locate borders of individual cells, separating touching cells, and enabling single cell analysis. Using the popular CellProfiler freeware cell image analysis software mainly targeted for fluorescence microscopy, we validate our method by automatically segmenting low contrast and rather complex shaped murine macrophage cells. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed approach frees up a fluorescence channel, which can be used for subcellular studies. It also facilitates cell shape measurement in experiments where whole cell fluorescent staining is either not available, or is dependent on a particular experimental condition. We show that whole cell area detection results using our projected bright field images match closely to the standard approach where cell areas are localized using fluorescence, and conclude that the high contrast bright field projection image can directly replace one fluorescent channel in whole cell quantification.

Therefore, Treg are a promising target for modulating immune responses to vaccines to improve their efficacy. Using a viral vector system, we found that Treg act on the developing immune response early postinfection by reducing the extent of dendritic cell costimulatory molecule expression. Due to this change and the lower IL-2 production that results, a substantial fraction of CD8(+) effector T cells lose CD25 expression several days after activation. Surprisingly, such Treg-dependent limitations in IL-2 signaling by Ag-activated CD8(+) T cells prevent effector differentiation without interfering with memory cell formation. In this way, Treg fine-tune the numbers of effector T cells generated while preserving the capacity for a rapid recall response upon pathogen re-exposure. This selective effect of Treg on a subpopulation of CD8(+) T cells indicates that although manipulation of the Treg compartment might not be optimal for prophylactic vaccinations, it can be potentially exploited to optimize vaccine efficacy for therapeutic interventions.",9/15/11,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,3186-97,,,187,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Female; Immunologic Memory; Inbred C57BL; Interleukin-2; Knockout; Mice; Regulatory; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; T-Lymphocytes; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Transgenic; Vaccinia virus; Viral Vaccines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In T cells, it is believed that lipid rafts aggregate at the site of T cell receptor engagement and act as foci for initiation of the signaling process. In order to gain insight into the possible functioning of lipid rafts, we applied microcapillary liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (microLC-ESI-MS/MS) methodologies to the identification of proteins which copurified with lipid rafts. Following isolation of lipid rafts as Triton-insoluble, low-density membrane fractions from Jurkat T cells, tryptic digests were generated of individual protein bands resolved electrophoretically. Alternatively, cysteine-containing peptides were isolated from total tryptic digests of unseparated lipid raft proteins following labeling with a cysteine-specific biotinylation reagent and avidin affinity purification. In both cases, protein identifications were made by comparison of tandem MS spectra generated by microLC-ESI-MS/MS to both protein and DNA sequence databases using Sequest software. Proteins identified essentially fell into two groups: cytoskeletal proteins, and proteins involved in signal transduction. These findings are discussed in the light of the current understanding of both lipid raft biology and signal transduction.",2001-08,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,1010-21,,8,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chromatography; Detergents; Electrophoresis; Humans; Ion Exchange; Jurkat Cells; Mass Spectrometry/*methods; Membrane Proteins/*chemistry/isolation & purification; Polyacrylamide Gel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the large number of protein kinases and their substrates generates an enormously complex phosphoproteome. The cyclin-dependent kinasesâ€°Ã›Ã’the CDKsâ€°Ã›Ã’comprise a class of enzymes that regulate cell cycle progression and play important roles in tumorigenesis. However, despite intense study, only a limited number of mammalian CDK substrates are known. A comprehensive understanding of CDK function requires the identification of their substrate network. RESULTS: We describe a simple and efficient approach to identify potential cyclin A-CDK2 targets in complex cell lysates. Using a kinase engineering strategy combined with chemical enrichment and mass spectrometry, we identified 180 potential cyclin A-CDK2 substrates and more than 200 phosphorylation sites. About 10% of these candidates function within pathways related to cell division, and the vast majority are involved in other fundamental cellular processes. We have validated several candidates as direct cyclin A-CDK2 substrates that are phosphorylated on the same sites that we identified by mass spectrometry, and we also found that one novel substrate, the ribosomal protein RL12, exhibits site-specific CDK2-dependent phosphorylation in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: We used methods entailing engineered kinases and thiophosphate enrichment to identify a large number of candidate CDK2 substrates in cell lysates. These results are consistent with other recent proteomic studies, and suggest that CDKs regulate cell division via large networks of cellular substrates. These methods are general and can be easily adapted to identify direct substrates of many other protein kinases.",2008,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,R149,,10,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/chemistry/*metabolism; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Phosphopeptides/chemistry; Phosphorylation; Protein Engineering; Ribosomal Proteins/chemistry/metabolism; Substrate Specificity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inbred strains of mice also vary in their susceptibility to obesity and therefore represent a valuable model to study the genetics and physiology of weight gain and its co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes. C57BL/6J mice are susceptible to obesity and insulin resistance when fed an obesogenic diet, whereas A/J mice are resistant despite increased caloric intake. Analysis of B6- and A/J-derived chromosome substitution strains and congenic strains revealed a complex genetic and physiological basis for this phenotype. To improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility to metabolic disease we analyzed global gene expression patterns in 6C1 and 6C2 congenic strains. 6C1 is susceptible whereas 6C2 is resistant to diet-induced obesity. In addition, we demonstrate that 6C1 is glucose intolerant and insulin resistant relative to 6C2. Pathway analysis of global gene expression patterns in muscle, adipose, and liver identified expression level differences between 6C1 and 6C2 in pathways related to basal transcription factors, endocytosis, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). The OxPhos expression differences were subtle but evident in each complex of the electron transport chain and were associated with a marked increase in mitochondrial oxidative capacity in the livers of the obese strain 6C1 relative to the obesity-resistant strain 6C2.

In order to better understand regulation of miRNA biosynthesis, we studied cleavage of primary miRNAs by Drosha. While Drosha knockdown triggers an expected decrease of many mature miRNAs in human embryonic stem cells (hESC), a subset of miRNAs are not reduced. Statistical analysis of miRNA secondary structure and fold change of expression in response to Drosha knockdown showed that absence of mismatches in the central region of the hairpin, 5 and 9-12 nt from the Drosha cutting site conferred decreased sensitivity to Drosha knockdown. This suggests that, when limiting, Drosha processes miRNAs without mismatches more efficiently than mismatched miRNAs. This is important because Drosha expression changes over cellular development and the fold change of expression for miRNAs with mismatches in the central region correlates with Drosha levels. To examine the biochemical relationship directly, we overexpressed structural variants of miRNA-145, miRNA-137, miRNA-9, and miRNA-200b in HeLa cells with and without Drosha knockdown; for these miRNAs, elimination of mismatches in the central region increased, and addition of mismatches decreased their expression in an in vitro assay and in cells with low Drosha expression.

Moreover, IL-1 signaling in T cells was required in dendritic cell-mediated Th17 cell differentiation from naive or regulatory precursors and IL-1 synergized with IL-6 and IL-23 to regulate Th17 cell differentiation and maintain cytokine expression in effector Th17 cells. Importantly, IL-1 regulated the expression of the transcription factors IRF4 and RORgammat during Th17 cell differentiation; overexpression of these two factors resulted in IL-1-independent Th17 cell polarization.

Recent investigations changed basic ideas on the dynamic character of Ca2+ signals and challenge traditional ideas on information transmission. <b>SCOPE OF REVIEW: </b>We present recent findings on key characteristics of the cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics and theoretical concepts that explain the wide range of experimentally observed Ca2+ signals. Further, we relate properties of the dynamical regulation of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration to ideas about information transmission by stochastic signals. <b>MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: </b>We demonstrate the importance of the hierarchal arrangement of Ca2+ release sites on the emergence of cellular Ca2+ spikes. Stochastic Ca2+ signals are functionally robust and adaptive to changing environmental conditions. Fluctuations of interspike intervals (ISIs) and the moment relation derived from ISI distributions contain information on the channel cluster open probability and on pathway properties. <b>GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: </b>Robust and reliable signal transduction pathways that entail Ca2+ dynamics are essential for eukaryotic organisms.

Surprisingly, Kap123p is not essential for growth, under normal conditions. To further explore the role of Kap123p in nucleocytoplasmic transport and ribosome biogenesis, we performed a synthetic fitness screen designed to identify genes that interact with KAP123. Through this analysis we have identified three other karyopherins, Pse1p/Kap121p, Sxm1p/Kap108p, and Nmd5p/Kap119p. We propose that, in the absence of Kap123p, these karyopherins are able to supplant Kap123pâ€°Ã›Âªs role in import. In addition to the karyopherins, we identified Rai1p, a protein previously implicated in rRNA processing. Rai1p is also not essential, but deletion of the RAI1 gene is deleterious to cell growth and causes defects in rRNA processing, which leads to an imbalance of the 60S/40S ratio and the accumulation of halfmers, 40S subunits assembled on polysomes that are unable to form functional ribosomes. Rai1p localizes predominantly to the nucleus, where it physically interacts with Rat1p and pre-60S ribosomal subunits. Analysis of the rai1/kap123 double mutant strain suggests that the observed genetic interaction results from an inability to efficiently export pre-60S subunits from the nucleus, which arises from a combination of compromised Kap123p-mediated nuclear import of the essential 60S ribosomal subunit export factor, Nmd3p, and a DeltaRAI1-induced decrease in the overall biogenesis efficiency.",2003-03,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,2042-54,,6,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Membrane Transport Proteins; Active Transport; Alleles; Carrier Proteins/genetics/*physiology; Cell Nucleus/*metabolism; Cell Nucleus/*physiology; Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*physiology; Exoribonucleases/metabolism; Fungal/*metabolism; Karyopherins/*physiology; Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology; Receptors; Ribosomes/*metabolism; RNA; RNA-Binding Proteins/physiology; RNA Precursors/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the paucity of samples relative to the gene number leads to problems such as overfitting and underconstrained regression analysis. Here we present a novel method for the sparse approximation of gene regulatory networks that addresses these issues. It is formulated as a sparse combinatorial optimization problem which has a globally optimal solution in terms of l(0) norm error. In order to seek an approximate solution of the l(0) optimization problem, we consider a heuristic approach based on iterative greedy algorithms. We apply our method to a set of gene expression profiles comprising of 24,102 genes measured over 79 human tissues.

This analysis reveals principles of cellular organization that we discuss along four conceptual axes.

(2) Behavior across scales: trends across global networks of varying resolution (composed of various numbers of modules) reveal principles of assembly of high-level behaviors from smaller components.

But how ratios of lineage-determining transcription factors stabilize progenitor cells and resolve their indeterminacy to commit them to discrete, mutually exclusive fates remains unexplained. We used a simple model and experimental measurements to analyze the dynamics of a binary fate decision governed by a gene-circuit containing auto-stimulation and cross-inhibition, as embodied by the GATA1-PU.1 paradigm. This circuit generates stable attractors corresponding to erythroid and myelomonocytic fates, as well as an uncommitted metastable state characterized by coexpression of both regulators, explaining the phenomenon of ""multilineage priming"". GATA1 and PU.1 mRNA and transcriptome dynamics of differentiating progenitor cells confirm that commitment occurs in two stages, as suggested by the model: first, the progenitor state is destabilized in an almost symmetrical bifurcation event, resulting in a poised state at the boundary between the two lineage-specific attractors; second, the cell is driven to the respective, now accessible attractors.

Such 'non-genetic cell individuality' can arise from the slow fluctuations of protein levels in mammalian cells. These fluctuations produce persistent cell individuality, thereby rendering a clonal population heterogeneous. However, it remains unknown whether this heterogeneity may account for the stochasticity of cell fate decisions in stem cells. Here we show that in clonal populations of mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells, spontaneous 'outlier' cells with either extremely high or low expression levels of the stem cell marker Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a; ref. 9) reconstitute the parental distribution of Sca-1 but do so only after more than one week. This slow relaxation is described by a gaussian mixture model that incorporates noise-driven transitions between discrete subpopulations, suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell type. Despite clonality, the Sca-1 outliers had distinct transcriptomes. Although their unique gene expression profiles eventually reverted to that of the median cells, revealing an attractor state, they lasted long enough to confer a greatly different proclivity for choosing either the erythroid or the myeloid lineage. Preference in lineage choice was associated with increased expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, such as a >200-fold increase in Gata1 (ref. 10) among the erythroid-prone cells, or a >15-fold increased PU.1 (Sfpi1) (ref. 11) expression among myeloid-prone cells.

The switching between these states has long been understood as a transition between attractor states of a molecular network. Herein, stochastic fluctuations are either suppressed or can trigger the transition, but they do not actually determine the attractor states. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present a novel mathematical concept in which stem cell and progenitor population dynamics are described as a probabilistic process that arises from cell proliferation and small fluctuations in the state of differentiation. These state fluctuations reflect random transitions between different activation patterns of the underlying regulatory network. Importantly, the associated noise amplitudes are state-dependent and set by the environment. Their variability determines the attractor states, and thus actually governs population dynamics. This model quantitatively reproduces the observed dynamics of differentiation and dedifferentiation in promyelocytic precursor cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Consequently, state-specific noise modulation by external signals can be instrumental in controlling stem cell and progenitor population dynamics.

This study seeks to understand how modules within developmental GRNs influence the complexity of multicellular patterns that emerge from the dynamics of the regulatory networks. We apply an algorithmic complexity to measure the organization of the patterns.

This demand has led to the development of a new mathematically based analysis of complex, metabolic networks that enumerates all their unique pathways that take into account all requirements for cofactors and byproducts. Applications include the design of engineered biological systems, the generation of testable hypotheses regarding network structure and function, and the elucidation of properties that can not be described by simple descriptions of individual components (such as product yield, network robustness, correlated reactions and predictions of minimal media).

Given the characteristics of hypersaline lakes, the unusually large numbers of TFBs in halophilic archaea further suggests that they might be especially important in rapid adaptation to the challenges of a dynamically changing environment. Motivated by these observations, we have investigated the implications of TFB expansions by correlating sequence variations, regulation, and physical interactions of all seven TFBs in Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 to their fitness landscapes, functional hierarchies, and genetic interactions across 2488 experiments covering combinatorial variations in salt, pH, temperature, and Cu stress. This systems analysis has revealed an elegant scheme in which completely novel fitness landscapes are generated by gene conversion events that introduce subtle changes to the regulation or physical interactions of duplicated TFBs. Based on these insights, we have introduced a synthetically redesigned TFB and altered the regulation of existing TFBs to illustrate how archaea can rapidly generate novel phenotypes by simply reprogramming their TFB regulatory network.",2011,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,554,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These networks range from those involving gene regulatory and protein-protein interactions underlying intracellular signaling pathways and single-cell responses to increasingly complex networks of in vivo cellular interaction, positioning, and migration that determine the overall immune response of an organism. Immunity is thus not the product of simple signaling events but rather nonlinear behaviors arising from dynamic, feedback-regulated interactions among many components. One of the major goals of systems immunology is to quantitatively measure these complex multiscale spatial and temporal interactions, permitting development of computational models that can be used to predict responses to perturbation. Recent technological advances permit collection of comprehensive datasets at multiple molecular and cellular levels, while advances in network biology support representation of the relationships of components at each level as physical or functional interaction networks. The latter facilitate effective visualization of patterns and recognition of emergent properties arising from the many interactions of genes, molecules, and cells of the immune system. We illustrate the power of integrating â€°Ã›Âªomicsâ€°Ã›Âª and network modeling approaches for unbiased reconstruction of signaling and transcriptional networks with a focus on applications involving the innate immune system.

Moreover, we identify Uba4p, Ncs2p, Ncs6p and Yor251cp as components of this conserved pathway. Using in vitro assays, we show that Ncs6p binds to tRNA, whereas Uba4p first adenylates and then directly transfers sulphur onto Urm1p.

Two previously unreported phenotypes of kap121 cells were observed: defects in mating and in the transition from the normal yeast form to the pseudohyphal, invasive form. In parallel, we searched for Kap121p cargoes by using Kap121p as a probe in overlay assays of yeast nuclear proteins. One of the major interacting proteins identified by this procedure was Ste12p, a transcription factor central to both the mating response and the pseudohyphal transition. We therefore investigated whether defects in these differentiation processes were due to an inability to import Ste12p. Both immunopurification and in vitro binding studies demonstrated that Ste12p interacted specifically with Kap121p in a Ran-GTP-sensitive manner and that Ste12p was mislocalized to the cytoplasm by inactivation of Kap121p in a temperature-sensitive mutant. The Kap121p-specific nuclear localization signal (NLS) of Ste12p was determined to reside within a C-terminal region of Ste12p. Furthermore, by overexpression of STE12 or expression of a STE12-cNLS fusion in kap121 cells, the invasive-growth defect and the mating defect were both suppressed. Together these data demonstrate that Ste12p is imported into nuclei by Kap121p and that mating and differentiation defects associated with kap121 mutants are primarily attributable to the mislocalization of Ste12p.",2002-04,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,2544-55,,8,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Membrane Transport Proteins; Active Transport; Cell Nucleus; Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/*metabolism; Fungal; Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism; Genes; Macromolecular Substances; Mutation; Nuclear Localization Signals; Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/metabolism; ran GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism; Receptors; Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/growth & development/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Temperature; Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such ""either-or"" fate decisions are controlled by two opposing cell fate-determining transcription factors. Each of the two distinct ""master regulators"" promotes differentiation of its respective sister lineage. But they also suppress one other, leading to their mutually exclusive expression in the two ensuing lineages. Thus, promiscuous coexistence of the antagonist regulators in the same cell, the hallmark of the common ""undecided"" progenitor of two sister lineages, is considered unstable. This antagonism ensures robust polarization into two discretely distinct cell types. But now the immune systemâ€°Ã›Âªs T-helper (Th) cells and their two canonical subtypes, Th1 and Th2 cells, tell a different story, as revealed in three papers recently published in PLOS Biology. The intermediate state that co-expresses the two opposing master regulators of the Th1 and Th2 subtypes, T-bet and Gata3, is highly stable and is not necessarily an undecided precursor. Instead, the Th1/Th2 hybrid cell is a robust new type with properties of both Th1 and Th2 cells. These hybrid cells are functionally active and possess the benefit of moderation: self-limitation of effector T cell function to prevent excessive inflammation, a permanent risk in host defense that can cause tissue damage or autoimmunity.

Further, TbNup92 is intimately associated with the mitotic spindle and spindle anchor site but apparently has minimal roles in control of gene transcription, indicating that TbNup92 lacks major barrier activity. TbNup92 therefore acts as a functional analogue of Mlp/Tpr proteins, and, together with the lamina analogue NUP-1, represents a cohort of novel proteins operating at the nuclear periphery of trypanosomes, uncovering complex evolutionary trajectories for the NPC and nuclear lamina.",2014-05,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,1421-36,,9,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most vertebrates have exactly one gene ortholog for each TLR family. The family including TLR1 has more species-specific adaptations than other families. A major family including TLR11 is represented in humans only by a pseudogene. Coincidental evolution plays a minor role in TLR evolution.

One of the proteins identified by this strategy is Utp8p, an essential 80-kDa nucleolar protein that has been implicated in 18 S ribosomal RNA biogenesis. Our characterization indicated that the major function of Utp8p is in nuclear tRNA export. Like the S. cerevisiae Los1p and the mammalian exportin-t, which are proteins known to facilitate nuclear tRNA export, overexpression of Utp8p restored export of tRNAamTyr mutants defective in nuclear export. Furthermore, depletion of Utp8p blocked nuclear export of mature tRNAs derived from both intronless and intron-containing pre-tRNAs but did not affect tRNA and rRNA maturation, nuclear export of mRNA and ribosomes, or nuclear tRNA aminoacylation. Overexpression of Utp8p also alleviated nuclear retention of non-aminoacylated tRNATyr in a tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase mutant strain. Utp8p binds tRNA directly and saturably, indicating that it has a tRNA-binding site. Utp8p does not appear to function as a tRNA export receptor, because it does not shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Taken together, the results suggest that Utp8p is an essential intranuclear component of the nuclear tRNA export machinery, which may channel tRNA to the various tRNA export pathways operating in S. cerevisiae.",8/22/03,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,32236-45,,34,278,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Base Sequence; Cell Nucleus/*metabolism; DNA Primers; Fungal/*metabolism; Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Protein Transport; RNA; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Selection (Genetics); Transfer/*metabolism; Two-Hybrid System Techniques,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present version 6 of the consensus yeast metabolic network (Yeast 6) as an update to the community effort to computationally reconstruct the genome-scale metabolic network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c. Yeast 6 comprises 1458 metabolites participating in 1888 reactions, which are annotated with 900 yeast genes encoding the catalyzing enzymes. Compared with Yeast 5, Yeast 6 demonstrates improved sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values for predicting gene essentiality in glucose-limited aerobic conditions when analyzed with flux balance analysis. Additionally, Yeast 6 improves the accuracy of predicting the likelihood that a mutation will cause auxotrophy. The network reconstruction is available as a Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) file enriched with Minimium Information Requested in the Annotation of Biochemical Models (MIRIAM)-compliant annotations. Small- and macromolecules in the network are referenced to authoritative databases such as Uniprot or ChEBI. Molecules and reactions are also annotated with appropriate publications that contain supporting evidence. Yeast 6 is freely available at http://yeast.sf.net/ as three separate SBML files: a model using the SBML level 3 Flux Balance Constraint package, a model compatible with the MATLAB(R) COBRA Toolbox for backward compatibility and a reconstruction containing only reactions for which there is experimental evidence (without the non-biological reactions necessary for simulating growth).

The eIF4Gs are phosphoproteins. However, the location of the phosphorylation sites, how phosphorylation of these proteins is modulated and the identity of the intracellular signaling pathways regulating eIF4G phosphorylation have not been established. In this report, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping demonstrates that the phosphorylation state of specific eIF4GI residues is altered by serum and mitogens. Phosphopeptides resolved by this method were mapped to the C-terminal one-third of the protein. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses identified the serum-stimulated phosphorylation sites in this region as serines 1108, 1148 and 1192. Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors and rapamycin, an inhibitor of the kinase FRAP/mTOR (FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein/mammalian target of rapamycin), prevent the serum-induced phosphorylation of these residues. Finally, the phosphorylation state of N-terminally truncated eIF4GI proteins acquires resistance to kinase inhibitor treatment. These data suggest that the kinases phosphorylating serines 1108, 1148 and 1192 are not directly downstream of PI3K and FRAP/mTOR, but that the accessibility of the C-terminus to kinases is modulated by this pathway(s).",1/1/00,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,434-44,,3,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Protein Kinases; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors; Amino Acid Sequence; Binding Sites; DNA Mutational Analysis; Electrophoresis; Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G; Gel; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Messenger/metabolism; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptide Initiation Factors/*chemistry/genetics; Peptide Mapping; Phosphopeptides/chemistry; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA; Sequence Alignment; Signal Transduction; Sirolimus/*pharmacology; Two-Dimensional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand this relationship, we have mapped domains of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mad1p that interact with the nuclear transport machinery, including further defining its interactions with the NPC. We showed that a Kap95p/Kap60p-dependent nuclear localization signal, positioned in the C-terminal third of Mad1p, is required for its efficient targeting to the NPC. At the NPC, Mad1p interacts with Nup53p and a presumed Nup60p/Mlp1p/Mlp2p complex through two coiled coil regions within its N terminus. When the SAC is activated, a portion of Mad1p is recruited to kinetochores through an interaction that is mediated by the C-terminal region of Mad1p and requires energy. We showed using photobleaching analysis that in nocodazole-arrested cells Mad1p rapidly cycles between the Mlp proteins and kinetochores.

During blooms, Phaeocystis can fix CO(2) at rates up to 40 g C m(-2) month(-1). Most of this carbon is released as polysaccharides. However, the cellular mechanism whereby this huge amount of organic material is exported into the seawater remains unknown. A vaguely defined process of ""exudation"" is believed responsible for the release of these biopolymers. Here we report the first demonstration that Phaeocystis globosa does not ""exude"", but secretes microscopic gels. Secretion is stimulated by blue light (lambda = 470+/-20 nm), and it is transduced by a characteristic intracellular Ca(2+) signal that precedes degranulation. The polysaccharides that form the matrix of these gels remain in condensed phase while stored in secretory vesicles. Upon exocytosis, the exopolymer matrix undergoes a characteristic phase transition accompanied by extensive swelling resulting in the formation of microscopic hydrated gels. Owing to their tangled topology, once released into the seawater, the polymers that make these gels can reptate (axially diffuse), interpenetrate neighboring gels, and anneal them together forming massive mucilage accumulations that are characteristic of Phaeocystis blooms. These gel masses can supply a rich source of microbial substrates, disperse in the seawater, and/or eventually sediment to the ocean floor.",2004-05,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,535-42,,5,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adhesives/metabolism; Bodily Secretions/*physiology/radiation effects; Calcium Signaling/physiology; Carbon Dioxide/metabolism; Exocytosis/*physiology/radiation effects; Gels/metabolism; Light; Light Signal Transduction/physiology; Photic Stimulation; Photosynthesis/physiology; Phytoplankton/cytology/*metabolism/radiation effects; Polymers/metabolism; Polysaccharides/metabolism/*secretion; Secretory Vesicles/metabolism/radiation effects/ultrastructure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have discovered that Caspase 8 can activate the NF-kappaB pathway independent of its activity as a pro-apoptotic protease. This property is localized to its N-terminal prodomain, which contains two homologous death effector domains (DEDs). Caspase 10 and MRIT, two DEDs-containing homologs of Caspase 8, can similarly activate the NF-kappaB pathway. Dominant-negative mutants of the Caspase 8 prodomain can block NF-kappaB induced by Caspase 8, FADD and several death receptors belonging to the TNFR family. Caspase 8 can interact with multiple proteins known to be involved in the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway, including the serine-threonine kinases RIP, NIK, IKK1 and IKK2.

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an incurable hematologic disorder, sensitive, early, and noninvasive diagnosis and better disease classification would be very useful for more effective therapies. We show here that circulating miRNAs can be sensitive biomarkers for CLL, because certain extracellular miRNAs are present in CLL patient plasma at levels significantly different from healthy controls and from patients affected by other hematologic malignancies. The levels of several of these circulating miRNAs also displayed significant differences between zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70)(+) and ZAP-70(-) CLL. We also determined that the level of circulating miR-20a correlates reliably with diagnosis-to-treatment time.

In addition to the amino acid sequence of the precursor, we determined by Edman degradation the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the mature hexameric glycoprotein present in the egg as well as that of its derived proteolytically modified fragments necessary for development beyond the blastula stage. The approximate C-termini of the fragments were determined by a combination of mass spectrometry and migration in reducing gels before and after deglycosylation. This new member of the transferrin family shows special features which explain its evolutionary adaptation to development and adhesive function in sea urchin embryos: (i) a protease-inhibiting WAP domain, (ii) a 280 amino acid cysteine-less insertion in the C-terminal lobe, and (iii) a 240 residue C-terminal extension with a modified cystine knot motif found in multisubunit external cell surface glycoproteins. Proteolytic removal of the N-terminal WAP domain generates the mature toposome present in the oocyte. The modified cystine knot motif stabilizes cell-bound trimers upon Ca-dependent dissociation of hexamer-linked cells. We determined the positions of the developmentally regulated cuts in the cysteine-less insertion, which produce the fragments observed previously. These fragments remain bound to the hexameric 22S particle in vivo and are released only after treatment of the purified toposome with reducing agents. In addition, some soluble smaller fragments with possible signal function are produced. Sequence comparison of five sea urchin species reveals the location of the cell-cell contact site targeted by the species-specific embryo dissociating antibodies.

However, there are few, if any, well-controlled observations of the evolutionary processes underlying the genesis of new mutualisms. Here, we show that within the first 1,000 generations of initiating independent syntrophic interactions between a sulfate reducer (Desulfovibrio vulgaris) and a hydrogenotrophic methanogen (Methanococcus maripaludis), D. vulgaris frequently lost the capacity to grow by sulfate respiration, thus losing the primary physiological attribute of the genus. The loss of sulfate respiration was a consequence of mutations in one or more of three key genes in the pathway for sulfate respiration, required for sulfate activation (sat) and sulfate reduction to sulfite (apsA or apsB). Because loss-of-function mutations arose rapidly and independently in replicated experiments, and because these mutations were correlated with enhanced growth rate and productivity, gene loss could be attributed to natural selection, even though these mutations should significantly restrict the independence of the evolved D. vulgaris. Together, these data present an empirical demonstration that specialization for a mutualistic interaction can evolve by natural selection shortly after its origin. They also demonstrate that a sulfate-reducing bacterium can readily evolve to become a specialized syntroph, a situation that may have often occurred in nature.",9/29/14,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose a method called probabilistic regulation of metabolism (PROM) that achieves this synthesis and enables straightforward, automated, and quantitative integration of high-throughput data into constraint-based modeling, making it an ideal tool for constructing genome-scale regulatory-metabolic network models for less-studied organisms. PROM introduces probabilities to represent gene states and gene-transcription factor interactions. By using PROM, we constructed an integrated regulatory-metabolic network for the model organism, Escherichia coli, and demonstrated that our method based on automated inference is more accurate and comprehensive than the current state of the art, which is based on manual curation of literature. After validating the approach, we used PROM to build a genome-scale integrated metabolic-regulatory model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a critically important human pathogen. This study incorporated data from more than 1,300 microarrays, 2,000 transcription factor-target interactions regulating 3,300 metabolic reactions, and 1,905 KO phenotypes for E. coli and M. tuberculosis.

While in adult cells G9a maintains E(y) in a repressed state via dimethylation of histone H3 at lysines 9 and 27, it activates beta(maj) transcription in a methyltransferase-independent manner. Interestingly, the demethylase UTX is recruited to the beta(maj) (but not the E(y)) promoter where it antagonizes G9a-dependent H3K27 dimethylation. Collectively, these results reveal a dual role for G9a in maintaining proper expression (both repression and activation) of the beta-globin genes in differentiating adult erythroid cells.",10/27/09,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,18303-8,,43,106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Aging; *Transcription; Animals; beta-Globins/*genetics; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Developmental; Erythroid Cells/cytology/*metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism; Histones/metabolism; Mice; NF-E2 Transcription Factor; p45 Subunit/metabolism; Protein Binding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NRC-1 and predicted proteome have been analyzed by computational methods and reveal characteristics relevant to life in an extreme environment distinguished by hypersalinity and high solar radiation: (1) The proteome is highly acidic, with a median pI of 4.9 and mostly lacking basic proteins. This characteristic correlates with high surface negative charge, determined through homology modeling, as the major adaptive mechanism of halophilic proteins to function in nearly saturating salinity. (2) Codon usage displays the expected GC bias in the wobble position and is consistent with a highly acidic proteome. (3) Distinct genomic domains of NRC-1 with bacterial character are apparent by whole proteome BLAST analysis, including two gene clusters coding for a bacterial-type aerobic respiratory chain. This result indicates that the capacity of halophiles for aerobic respiration may have been acquired through lateral gene transfer. (4) Two regions of the large chromosome were found with relatively lower GC composition and overrepresentation of IS elements, similar to the minichromosomes. These IS-element-rich regions of the genome may serve to exchange DNA between the three replicons and promote genome evolution.

Proteins from stimulated cells (interferon-alpha treatment for the Huh7 and HFH cells and induction of hepatitis C virus [HCV] proteins for the HH4 cells) and corresponding control cells were labeled with light and heavy cleavable ICAT reagents, respectively. The labeled samples were combined, trypsinized, and subject to cation-exchange and avidin-affinity chromatographies. The resulting cysteine-containing peptides were analyzed by microcapillary LC-MS/MS. The MS/MS spectra were initially analyzed by searching the human International Protein Index database using the SEQUEST software (1). Subsequently, new statistical algorithms were applied to the collective SEQUEST search results of each experiment. First, the PeptideProphet software (2) was applied to discriminate true assignments of MS/MS spectra to peptide sequences from false assignments, to assign a probability value for each identified peptide, and to compute the sensitivity and error rate for the assignment of spectra to sequences in each experiment. Second, the ProteinProphet software (3) was used to infer the protein identifications and to compute probabilities that a protein had been correctly identified, based on the available peptide sequence evidence. The resulting protein lists were filtered by a ProteinProphet probability score p > or = 0.5, which corresponded to an error rate of less than 5%. A total of 1,296, 1,430, and 1,476 proteins or related protein groups were identified in three subdatasets from the Huh7, HFH, and HH4 cells, respectively.

Typically, investigators must choose a subset of SNPs from these databases to employ in their studies. The choice of subset is influenced by many factors, including estimated or known reliability of the SNP, biochemical factors, intellectual property, cost, and effectiveness of the subset for mapping genes or identifying disease loci. We present an evolutionary algorithm for multiobjective SNP selection. RESULTS: We implemented a modified version of the Strength-Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2) in Java. Our implementation, Multiobjective Analyzer for Genetic Marker Acquisition (MAGMA), approximates the set of optimal trade-off solutions for large problems in minutes. This set is very useful for the design of large studies, including those oriented towards disease identification, genetic mapping, population studies, and haplotype-block elucidation. CONCLUSION: Evolutionary algorithms are particularly suited for optimization problems that involve multiple objectives and a complex search space on which exact methods such as exhaustive enumeration cannot be applied. They provide flexibility with respect to the problem formulation if a problem description evolves or changes. Results are produced as a trade-off front, allowing the user to make informed decisions when prioritizing factors. MAGMA is open source and available at http://snp-magma.sourceforge.net.

We report here a novel method for rapid and sensitive miRNA detection and quantitation using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor technology and a DNA*RNA antibody-based assay. The approach takes advantage of a novel high-performance portable SPR sensor instrument for spectroscopy of surface plasmons based on a special diffraction grating called a surface plasmon coupler and disperser (SPRCD). The surface of the grating is functionalized with thiolated DNA oligonucleotides which specifically capture miRNA from a liquid sample without amplification. Subsequently, an antibody that recognizes DNA*RNA hybrids is introduced to bind to the DNA*RNA complex and enhance sensor response to the captured miRNA. This approach allows detection of miRNA in less than 30 min at concentrations down to 2 pM with an absolute amount at high attomoles. The methodology is evaluated for analysis of miRNA from mouse liver tissues and is found to yield results which agree well with those provided by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).",12/15/10,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,10110-5,,24,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The statistical significance, as expressed in a P-value, is calculated as the fraction of permutation values that are at least as extreme as the original statistic, which was derived from non-permuted data. This empirical method directly couples both the minimal obtainable P-value and the resolution of the P-value to the number of permutations. Thereby, it imposes upon itself the need for a very large number of permutations when small P-values are to be accurately estimated. This is computationally expensive and often infeasible. RESULTS: A method of computing P-values based on tail approximation is presented. The tail of the distribution of permutation values is approximated by a generalized Pareto distribution. A good fit and thus accurate P-value estimates can be obtained with a drastically reduced number of permutations when compared with the standard empirical way of computing P-values.

The reliability of quantitative proteomics is tightly linked to the reproducibility and stability of the analytical platforms, which are typically multicomponent (e.g. sample preparation, multistep separations, and mass spectrometry) with individual components contributing unequally to the overall system reproducibility. Variations in quantitative accuracy are thus inevitable, and quality control and calibration become essential for the assessment of the quality of the analyses themselves. Toward this end, the use of internal standards cannot only assist in the detection and removal of outlier data acquired by an irreproducible system (quality control) but can also be used for detection of changes in instruments for their subsequent performance and calibration. Here we introduce a set of halogenated peptides as internal standards. The peptides are custom designed to have properties suitable for various quality control assessments, data calibration, and normalization processes. The unique isotope distribution of halogenated peptides makes their mass spectral detection easy and unambiguous when spiked into complex peptide mixtures. In addition, they were designed to elute sequentially over an entire aqueous to organic LC gradient and to have m/z values within the commonly scanned mass range (300-1800 Da). In a series of experiments in which these peptides were spiked into an enriched N-glycosite peptide fraction (i.e. from formerly N-glycosylated intact proteins in their deglycosylated form) isolated from human plasma, we show the utility and performance of these halogenated peptides for sample preparation and LC injection quality control as well as for retention time and mass calibration.

We have used a loosely coupled, service-oriented infrastructure to develop SeqAdapt. This system streamlines data management and allows for rapid integration of novel algorithms.

With exponentially increasing sequencing capacity, there is an enormous need for automated reconstruction techniques that can provide more accurate models in a short time frame. Current methods for automated metabolic network reconstruction rely on gene and reaction annotations to build draft metabolic networks and algorithms to fill gaps in these networks. However, automated reconstruction is hampered by database inconsistencies, incorrect annotations, and gap filling largely without considering genomic information. Here we develop an approach for applying genomic information to predict alternative functions for genes and estimate their likelihoods from sequence homology. We show that computed likelihood values were significantly higher for annotations found in manually curated metabolic networks than those that were not. We then apply these alternative functional predictions to estimate reaction likelihoods, which are used in a new gap filling approach called likelihood-based gap filling to predict more genomically consistent solutions. To validate the likelihood-based gap filling approach, we applied it to models where essential pathways were removed, finding that likelihood-based gap filling identified more biologically relevant solutions than parsimony-based gap filling approaches. We also demonstrate that models gap filled using likelihood-based gap filling provide greater coverage and genomic consistency with metabolic gene functions compared to parsimony-based approaches. Interestingly, despite these findings, we found that likelihoods did not significantly affect consistency of gap filled models with Biolog and knockout lethality data. This indicates that the phenotype data alone cannot necessarily be used to discriminate between alternative solutions for gap filling and therefore, that the use of other information is necessary to obtain a more accurate network.

We present a new tool called reSpect, implemented in the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP), which enables an iterative workflow whereby fragment ion peaks explained by a peptide ion identified in one round of sequence searching or spectral library search are attenuated based on the confidence of the identification, and then the altered spectrum is subjected to further rounds of searching. The reSpect tool is not implemented as a search engine, but rather as a post-search engine processing step where only fragment ion intensities are altered. This enables the application of any search engine combination in the iterations that follow. Thus, reSpect is compatible with all other protein sequence database search engines as well as peptide spectral library search engines that are supported by the TPP. We show that while some datasets are highly amenable to chimeric spectrum identification and lead to additional peptide identification boosts of over 30% with as many as four different peptide ions identified per spectrum, datasets with narrow precursor ion selection only benefit from such processing at the level of a few percent. We demonstrate a technique that facilitates the determination of the degree to which a dataset would benefit from chimeric spectrum analysis. The reSpect tool is free and open source, provided within the TPP and available at the TPP website.

Each of these tools typically excels at one type of analysis, such as of microarrays, of metabolic networks and of predicted protein structure. A crucial challenge is to combine the capabilities of these (and other forthcoming) data resources and tools to create a data exploration and analysis environment that does justice to the variety and complexity of systems biology data sets. A solution to this problem should recognize that data types, formats and software in this high throughput age of biology are constantly changing. RESULTS: In this paper we describe the Gaggle -a simple, open-source Java software environment that helps to solve the problem of software and database integration. Guided by the classic software engineering strategy of separation of concerns and a policy of semantic flexibility, it integrates existing popular programs and web resources into a user-friendly, easily-extended environment. We demonstrate that four simple data types (names, matrices, networks, and associative arrays) are sufficient to bring together diverse databases and software. We highlight some capabilities of the Gaggle with an exploration of Helicobacter pylori pathogenesis genes, in which we identify a putative ricin-like protein -a discovery made possible by simultaneous data exploration using a wide range of publicly available data and a variety of popular bioinformatics software tools. CONCLUSION: We have integrated diverse databases (for example, KEGG, BioCyc, String) and software (Cytoscape, DataMatrixViewer, R statistical environment, and TIGR Microarray Expression Viewer). Through this loose coupling of diverse software and databases the Gaggle enables simultaneous exploration of experimental data (mRNA and protein abundance, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions), functional associations (operon, chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic pattern), metabolic pathways (KEGG) and Pubmed abstracts (STRING web resource), creating an exploratory environment useful to â€°Ã›Âªweb browser and spreadsheet biologistsâ€°Ã›Âª, to statistically savvy computational biologists, and those in between.

As scientists work in isolated groups, integration with other groups is rarely a consideration when building the required software tools. RESULTS: We illustrate an approach, through the discussion of a purpose built software architecture, which allows disparate groups to reuse tools and access data sources in a common manner. The architecture allows for: the rapid development of distributed applications; interoperability, so it can be used by a wide variety of developers and computational biologists; development using standard tools, so that it is easy to maintain and does not require a large development effort; extensibility, so that new technologies and data types can be incorporated; and non intrusive development, insofar as researchers need not to adhere to a pre-existing object model.

Collectively, these data can be analyzed for such purposes as disease diagnosis or phenotype classification. One family of algorithms that has proven useful for disease classification is based on relative expression analysis and includes the Top-Scoring Pair (TSP), k-Top-Scoring Pairs (k-TSP), Top-Scoring Triplet (TST) and Differential Rank Conservation (DIRAC) algorithms. These relative expression analysis algorithms hold significant advantages for identifying interpretable molecular signatures for disease classification, and have been implemented previously on a variety of computational platforms with varying degrees of usability. To increase the user-base and maximize the utility of these methods, we developed the program AUREA (Adaptive Unified Relative Expression Analyzer)-a cross-platform tool that has a consistent application programming interface (API), an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI), fast running times and automated parameter discovery. RESULTS: Herein, we describe AUREA, an efficient, cohesive, and user-friendly open-source software system that comprises a suite of methods for relative expression analysis. AUREA incorporates existing methods, while extending their capabilities and bringing uniformity to their interfaces. We demonstrate that combining these algorithms and adaptively tuning parameters on the training sets makes these algorithms more consistent in their performance and demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive parameter tuner by comparing accuracy across diverse datasets. CONCLUSIONS: We have integrated several relative expression analysis algorithms and provided a unified interface for their implementation while making data acquisition, parameter fixing, data merging, and results analysis 'point-and-click' simple.

Technical limitations of current proteomic platforms such as limited reproducibility and low throughput make this a challenging task. A new LC-MS-based platform is able to generate complex peptide patterns from the analysis of proteolyzed protein samples at high throughput and represents a promising approach for quantitative proteomics. A crucial component of the LC-MS approach is the accurate evaluation of the abundance of detected peptides over many samples and the identification of peptide features that can stratify samples with respect to their genetic, physiological, or environmental origins. We present here a new software suite, SpecArray, that generates a peptide versus sample array from a set of LC-MS data. A peptide array stores the relative abundance of thousands of peptide features in many samples and is in a format identical to that of a gene expression microarray. A peptide array can be subjected to an unsupervised clustering analysis to stratify samples or to a discriminant analysis to identify discriminatory peptide features. We applied the SpecArray to analyze two sets of LC-MS data: one was from four repeat LC-MS analyses of the same glycopeptide sample, and another was from LC-MS analysis of serum samples of five male and five female mice.

Increasingly, proteomic measurements are also supporting hypothesis-driven studies, in which a predetermined set of proteins is consistently detected and quantified in multiple samples. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is a targeted mass spectrometric technique that supports the detection and quantification of specific proteins in complex samples at high sensitivity and reproducibility. Here, we describe ATAQS, an integrated software platform that supports all stages of targeted, SRM-based proteomics experiments including target selection, transition optimization and post acquisition data analysis. This software will significantly facilitate the use of targeted proteomic techniques and contribute to the generation of highly sensitive, reproducible and complete datasets that are particularly critical for the discovery and validation of targets in hypothesis-driven studies in systems biology. Result We introduce a new open source software pipeline, ATAQS (Automated and Targeted Analysis with Quantitative SRM), which consists of a number of modules that collectively support the SRM assay development workflow for targeted proteomic experiments (project management and generation of protein, peptide and transitions and the validation of peptide detection by SRM). ATAQS provides a flexible pipeline for end-users by allowing the workflow to start or end at any point of the pipeline, and for computational biologists, by enabling the easy extension of java algorithm classes for their own algorithm plug-in or connection via an external web site. This integrated system supports all steps in a SRM-based experiment and provides a user-friendly GUI that can be run by any operating system that allows the installation of the Mozilla Firefox web browser. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted proteomics via SRM is a powerful new technique that enables the reproducible and accurate identification and quantification of sets of proteins of interest. ATAQS is the first open-source software that supports all steps of the targeted proteomics workflow. ATAQS also provides software API (Application Program Interface) documentation that enables the addition of new algorithms to each of the workflow steps.

A variety of configurations exist with varying degrees of precision and cost, but the ultimate goal is the reproducible delivery of peptides in well-separated elution peaks. It is well-known that the quality of chromatography can have a dramatic effect on sample identification as well as run-to-run reproducibility, which is especially important for quantitative analyses.

We developed a new method for generating artificial sequences that are modeled after real intergenic sequences in terms of composition, complexity and interspersed repeat content. These artificial sequences can serve as an inexhaustible source of high-quality negative controls. We used artificial sequences to evaluate the false-positive rates of a set of programs for detecting interspersed repeats, ab initio prediction of coding genes, transcribed regions and non-coding genes. We found that RepeatMasker is more accurate than PClouds, Augustus has the lowest false-positive rate of the coding gene prediction programs tested, and Infernal has a low false-positive rate for non-coding gene detection.

Computational biologists attempt to understand, predict and manipulate biological system behavior through mathematical modeling and computer simulation. Discrete agent-based modeling (in combination with high-resolution grids to model the extracellular environment) is a popular approach for building biological system models. However, the computational complexity of this approach forces computational biologists to resort to coarser resolution approaches to simulate large biological systems. High-performance parallel computers have the potential to address the computing challenge, but writing efficient software for parallel computers is difficult and time-consuming. RESULTS: We have developed Biocellion, a high-performance software framework, to solve this computing challenge using parallel computers. To support a wide range of multicellular biological system models, Biocellion asks users to provide their model specifics by filling the function body of pre-defined model routines. Using Biocellion, modelers without parallel computing expertise can efficiently exploit parallel computers with less effort than writing sequential programs from scratch. We simulate cell sorting, microbial patterning and a bacterial system in soil aggregate as case studies.

Visualization and exploration of this data is critical to understanding the regulatory logic encoded in the genome by which the cell dynamically affects its physiology and interacts with its environment. RESULTS: The Gaggle Genome Browser is a cross-platform desktop program for interactively visualizing high-throughput data in the context of the genome. Important features include dynamic panning and zooming, keyword search and open interoperability through the Gaggle framework. Users may bookmark locations on the genome with descriptive annotations and share these bookmarks with other users. The program handles large sets of user-generated data using an in-process database and leverages the facilities of SQL and the R environment for importing and manipulating data.A key aspect of the Gaggle Genome Browser is interoperability. By connecting to the Gaggle framework, the genome browser joins a suite of interconnected bioinformatics tools for analysis and visualization with connectivity to major public repositories of sequences, interactions and pathways. To this flexible environment for exploring and combining data, the Gaggle Genome Browser adds the ability to visualize diverse types of data in relation to its coordinates on the genome. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic coordinates function as a common key by which disparate biological data types can be related to one another.

The Urologic Epithelial Stem Cells (UESC) database http://scgap.systemsbiology.net/ is a public database that contains gene and protein information for the major cell types of the prostate, prostate cancers cell lines, and a cancers cell type isolated from a primary tumor. Similarly, such information is available for urinary bladder cell types. DESCRIPTION: Two major data types were archived in the database, protein abundance localization data from immunohistochemistry images, and transcript abundance data principally from DNA microarray analysis. Data results were organized in modules that were made to operate independently but built upon a core functionality. Gene array data and immunostaining images for human and mouse prostate and bladder were made available for interrogation. Data analysis capabilities include: (1) CD (cluster designation) cell surface protein data. For each cluster designation molecule, a data summary allows easy retrieval of images (at multiple magnifications). (2) Microarray data. Single gene or batch search can be initiated with Affymetrix Probeset ID, Gene Name, or Accession Number together with options of coalescing probesets and/or replicates. CONCLUSION: Databases are invaluable for biomedical research, and their utility depends on data quality and user friendliness. UESC provides for database queries and tools to examine cell type-specific gene expression (normal vs. cancers), whereas most other databases contain only whole tissue expression datasets. The UESC database provides a valuable tool in the analysis of differential gene expression in prostate cancers genes in cancers progression.",2007,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,19,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Gene Expression Regulation; *Internet; Animals; Databases; Factual/*statistics & numerical data; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Mice; Neoplastic; Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism; Stem Cells/*classification; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism; Urothelium/*cytology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But integrating data from multiple sources is often encumbered by the need to reformat data files, convert between naming systems, or perform ongoing maintenance of local copies of public databases. Opportunities for new ways of combining and re-using data are arising as a result of the increasing use of web protocols to transmit structured data. RESULTS: The Firegoose, an extension to the Mozilla Firefox web browser, enables data transfer between web sites and desktop tools. As a component of the Gaggle integration framework, Firegoose can also exchange data with Cytoscape, the R statistical package, Multiexperiment Viewer (MeV), and several other popular desktop software tools. Firegoose adds the capability to easily use local data to query KEGG, EMBL STRING, DAVID, and other widely-used bioinformatics web sites. Query results from these web sites can be transferred to desktop tools for further analysis with a few clicks. Firegoose acquires data from the web by screen scraping, microformats, embedded XML, or web services. We define a microformat, which allows structured information compatible with the Gaggle to be embedded in HTML documents. We demonstrate the capabilities of this software by performing an analysis of the genes activated in the microbe Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 in response to anaerobic environments. Starting with microarray data, we explore functions of differentially expressed genes by combining data from several public web resources and construct an integrated view of the cellular processes involved. CONCLUSIONS: The Firegoose incorporates Mozilla Firefox into the Gaggle environment and enables interactive sharing of data between diverse web resources and desktop software tools without maintaining local copies. Additional web sites can be incorporated easily into the framework using the scripting platform of the Firefox browser.

D.",Relationship estimation from whole-genome sequence data,PLOS Geneticsics,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004144,,"The determination of the relationship between a pair of individuals is a fundamental application of genetics. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that identity-by-descent (IBD) information generated from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data can greatly improve the power and accuracy of genetic relationship detection. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) marks the final step in increasing genetic marker density by assaying all single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), and thus has the potential to further improve relationship detection by enabling more accurate detection of IBD segments and more precise resolution of IBD segment boundaries. However, WGS introduces new complexities that must be addressed in order to achieve these improvements in relationship detection. To evaluate these complexities, we estimated genetic relationships from WGS data for 1490 known pairwise relationships among 258 individuals in 30 families along with 46 population samples as controls. We identified several genomic regions with excess pairwise IBD in both the pedigree and control datasets using three established IBD methods: GERMLINE, fastIBD, and ISCA. These spurious IBD segments produced a 10-fold increase in the rate of detected false-positive relationships among controls compared to high-density microarray datasets. To address this issue, we developed a new method to identify and mask genomic regions with excess IBD. This method, implemented in ERSA 2.0, fully resolved the inflated cryptic relationship detection rates while improving relationship estimation accuracy. ERSA 2.0 detected all 1(st) through 6(th) degree relationships, and 55% of 9(th) through 11(th) degree relationships in the 30 families. We estimate that WGS data provides a 5% to 15% increase in relationship detection power relative to high-density microarray data for distant relationships. Our results identify regions of the genome that are highly problematic for IBD mapping and introduce new software to accurately detect 1(st) through 9(th) degree relationships from whole-genome sequence data.",2014-01,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e1004144,,1,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, data mining analyses are yielding ranked and heterogeneous results and association networks distributed over the entire genome. The visualization of these results is often difficult and standalone web tools allowing for custom inputs and dynamic filtering are limited. <b>RESULTS: </b>We have developed POMO (http://pomo.cs.tut.fi), an interactive web-based application to visually explore omics data analysis results and associations in circular, network and grid views. The circular graph represents the chromosome lengths as perimeter segments, as a reference outer ring, such as cytoband for human. The inner arcs between nodes represent the uploaded network. Further, multiple annotation rings, for example depiction of gene copy number changes, can be uploaded as text files and represented as bar, histogram or heatmap rings. POMO has built-in references for human, mouse, nematode, fly, yeast, zebrafish, rice, tomato, Arabidopsis, and Escherichia coli. In addition, POMO provides custom options that allow integrated plotting of unsupported strains or closely related species associations, such as human and mouse orthologs or two yeast wild types, studied together within a single analysis. The web application also supports interactive label and weight filtering. Every iterative filtered result in POMO can be exported as image file and text file for sharing or direct future input. <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The POMO web application is a unique tool for omics data analysis, which can be used to visualize and filter the genome-wide networks in the context of chromosomal locations as well as multiple network layouts. With the several illustration and filtering options the tool supports the analysis and visualization of any heterogeneous omics data analysis association results for many organisms.

J.",Markov Logic Networks in the Analysis of Genetic Data,Journal of Computational Biology,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cmb.2010.0044,,"Abstract Complex, non-additive genetic interactions are common and can be critical in determining phenotypes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and similar statistical studies of linkage data, however, assume additive models of gene interactions in looking for genotype-phenotype associations. These statistical methods view the compound effects of multiple genes on a phenotype as a sum of influences of each gene and often miss a substantial part of the heritable effect. Such methods do not use any biological knowledge about underlying mechanisms. Modeling approaches from the artificial intelligence (AI) field that incorporate deterministic knowledge into models to perform statistical analysis can be applied to include prior knowledge in genetic analysis. We chose to use the most general such approach, Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), for combining deterministic knowledge with statistical analysis. Using simple, logistic regression-type MLNs we can replicate the results of traditional statistical methods, but we also show that we are able to go beyond finding independent markers linked to a phenotype by using joint inference without an independence assumption. The method is applied to genetic data on yeast sporulation, a complex phenotype with gene interactions. In addition to detecting all of the previously identified loci associated with sporulation, our method identifies four loci with smaller effects. Since their effect on sporulation is small, these four loci were not detected with methods that do not account for dependence between markers due to gene interactions. We show how gene interactions can be detected using more complex models, which can be used as a general framework for incorporating systems biology with genetics.",10/20/10,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, predictions of protein phosphorylation and signaling networks remain a significant challenge, lagging behind predictions of transcriptional regulatory networks into which they often feed. RESULTS: We developed PhosphoChain to predict kinases, phosphatases and chains of phosphorylation events in signaling networks by combining mRNA expression levels of regulators and targets with a motif detection algorithm and optional prior information. PhosphoChain correctly reconstructed approximately 78% of the yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway from publicly available data. When tested on yeast phosphoproteomic data from large-scale mass spectrometry experiments, PhosphoChain correctly identified approximately 27% more phosphorylation sites than existing motif detection tools (NetPhosYeast and GPS2.0), and predictions of kinase-phosphatase interactions overlapped with approximately 59% of known interactions present in yeast databases. PhosphoChain provides a valuable framework for predicting condition-specific phosphorylation events from high-throughput data.

The top-scoring 'N' (TSN) algorithm is a generalized form of other relative expression algorithms which uses generic permutations and a dynamic classifier size to control both the permutation and combination space available for classification. RESULTS: TSN was tested on nine cancers datasets, showing statistically significant differences in classification accuracy between different classifier sizes (choices of N). TSN also performed competitively against a wide variety of different classification methods, including artificial neural networks, classification trees, discriminant analysis, k-Nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, and support vector machines, when tested on the Microarray Quality Control II datasets. Furthermore, TSN exhibits low levels of overfitting on training data compared to other methods, giving confidence that results obtained during cross validation will be more generally applicable to external validation sets. CONCLUSIONS: TSN preserves the strengths of other relative expression algorithms while allowing a much larger permutation and combination space to be explored, potentially improving classification accuracies when fewer numbers of measured features are available.",2012,2/8/16 23:58,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,13,,BMC Bioinformatics,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,*Algorithms; *Gene Expression; Classification/methods; Humans; Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism; Neural Networks (Computer); Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Support Vector Machines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many circumstances we are interested in finding targets that are expressed periodically. To tackle the problems of uneven sampling and unknown type of noise in periodicity detection, we propose to use robust regression. METHODS: The aim of this paper is to develop a general framework for robust periodicity detection and review and rank different approaches by means of simulations. We also show the results for some real measurement data. RESULTS: The simulation results clearly show that when the sampling of time series gets more and more uneven, the methods that assume even sampling become unusable. We find that M-estimation provides a good compromise between robustness and computational efficiency. CONCLUSION: Since uneven sampling occurs often in biological measurements, the robust methods developed in this paper are expected to have many uses. The regression based formulation of the periodicity detection problem easily adapts to non-uniform sampling. Using robust regression helps to reject inconsistently behaving data points.

Bees have been a model system for sociality and group behavior for decades but only recently have molecular techniques been brought to study this fascinating and valuable organism. With the release of the first draft of its genome in 2006, proteomics of bees became feasible and over the past five years we have amassed in excess of 5E+6 MS/MS spectra. The lack of a consolidated platform to organize this massive resource hampers our ability, and that of others, to mine the information to its maximum potential.

Although this justification is controversial, the general direction holds promise. This commentary clarifies points of disagreement and unresolved issues, and addresses mis-applications of evolutionary theory that lead the authors to adopt a Darwinian (versus Lamarckian) approach. To say that creativity is Darwinian is not to say that it consists of variation plus selection - in the everyday sense of the term - as the authors imply; it is to say that evolution is occurring because selection is affecting the distribution of randomly generated heritable variation across generations. In creative thought the distribution of variants is not key, i.e., one is not inclined toward idea A because 60 % of one's candidate ideas are variants of A while only 40 % are variants of B; one is inclined toward whichever seems best. The authors concede that creative variation is partly directed; however, the greater the extent to which variants are generated non-randomly, the greater the extent to which the distribution of variants can reflect not selection but the initial generation bias. Since each thought in a creative process can alter the selective criteria against which the next is evaluated, there is no demarcation into generations as assumed in a Darwinian model. We address the authors' claim that reduced variability and individuality are more characteristic of Lamarckism than Darwinian evolution, and note that a Lamarckian approach to creativity has addressed the challenge of modeling the emergent features associated with insight.",11/2/15,2/8/16 18:55,2/8/16 19:01,,,,,,,Psychon Bull Rev,,,,,,,,Eng,,,,,,,,"<p>Gabora, Liane<br/>Kauffman, Stuart<br/>Psychon Bull Rev. 2015 Nov 2.</p>; The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:<br/>auth-address: Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Okanagan Campus, 1147 Research Road, Kelowna, BC, V1V 1V7, Canada. liane.gabora@ubc.ca.

A range of computational tools is now available for both isotopically labeled and label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based quantitative proteomics. However, they are generally not comparable to each other in terms of functionality, user interfaces, information input/output, and do not readily facilitate appropriate statistical data analysis. These limitations, along with the array of choices, present a daunting prospect for biologists, and other researchers not trained in bioinformatics, who wish to use LC-MS-based quantitative proteomics. RESULTS: We have developed Corra, a computational framework and tools for discovery-based LC-MS proteomics. Corra extends and adapts existing algorithms used for LC-MS-based proteomics, and statistical algorithms, originally developed for microarray data analyses, appropriate for LC-MS data analysis. Corra also adapts software engineering technologies (e.g. Google Web Toolkit, distributed processing) so that computationally intense data processing and statistical analyses can run on a remote server, while the user controls and manages the process from their own computer via a simple web interface. Corra also allows the user to output significantly differentially abundant LC-MS-detected peptide features in a form compatible with subsequent sequence identification via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). We present two case studies to illustrate the application of Corra to commonly performed LC-MS-based biological workflows: a pilot biomarker discovery study of glycoproteins isolated from human plasma samples relevant to type 2 diabetes, and a study in yeast to identify in vivo targets of the protein kinase Ark1 via phosphopeptide profiling. CONCLUSION: The Corra computational framework leverages computational innovation to enable biologists or other researchers to process, analyze and visualize LC-MS data with what would otherwise be a complex and not user-friendly suite of tools. Corra enables appropriate statistical analyses, with controlled false-discovery rates, ultimately to inform subsequent targeted identification of differentially abundant peptides by MS/MS. For the user not trained in bioinformatics, Corra represents a complete, customizable, free and open source computational platform enabling LC-MS-based proteomic workflows, and as such, addresses an unmet need in the LC-MS proteomics field.",2008,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,542,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Software; Chromatography; Computational Biology; Internet; Liquid/*methods; Mass Spectrometry/*methods; Proteins/*analysis; Proteome/analysis; Proteomics/*methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They include poor fragmentation of the selected precursor ion, the presence of modified residues in the peptide, mismatches with sequence databases, and frequently, the concurrent fragmentation of multiple precursors in the same CID attempt. Current database search engines are incapable of correctly assigning the sequences of multiple precursors to such spectra. We have developed a search engine, ProbIDtree, which can identify multiple peptides from a CID spectrum generated by the concurrent fragmentation of multiple precursor ions. This is achieved by iterative database searching in which the submitted spectra are generated by subtracting the fragment ions assigned to a tentatively matched peptide from the acquired spectrum and in which each match is assigned a tentative probability score. Tentatively matched peptides are organized in a tree structure from which their adjusted probability scores are calculated and used to determine the correct identifications.

Here we applied the isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) approach to quantitative protein profiling, in this case proteins that copurified with lipid raft plasma membrane domains isolated from control and stimulated Jurkat human T cells. With the ICAT approach, cysteine residues of the two related protein isolates were covalently labeled with isotopically normal and heavy versions of the same reagent, respectively. Following proteolytic cleavage of combined labeled proteins, peptides were fractionated by multidimensional chromatography and subsequently analyzed via automated tandem mass spectrometry. Individual tandem mass spectrometry spectra were searched against a human sequence database, and a variety of recently developed, publicly available software applications were used to sort, filter, analyze, and compare the results of two repetitions of the same experiment. In particular, robust statistical modeling algorithms were used to assign measures of confidence to both peptide sequences and the proteins from which they were likely derived, identified via the database searches. We show that by applying such statistical tools to the identification of T cell lipid raft-associated proteins, we were able to estimate the accuracy of peptide and protein identifications made. These tools also allow for determination of the false positive rate as a function of user-defined data filtering parameters, thus giving the user significant control over and information about the final output of large-scale proteomic experiments. With the ability to assign probabilities to all identifications, the need for manual verification of results is substantially reduced, thus making the rapid evaluation of large proteomic datasets possible.

Quantitative proteomics based on differential stable isotope labeling is one of the proteomics quantification technologies. Mass spectrometric data generated for peptide quantification are often noisy, and peak detection and definition require various smoothing filters to remove noise in order to achieve accurate peptide quantification. Many traditional smoothing filters, such as the moving average filter, Savitzky-Golay filter and Gaussian filter, have been used to reduce noise in MS peaks. However, limitations of these filtering approaches often result in inaccurate peptide quantification. Here we present the WaveletQuant program, based on wavelet theory, for better or alternative MS-based proteomic quantification.

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is one of earth's most pervasive environmental stressors, potentially damaging DNA in any organism exposed to solar radiation. We explored mechanisms underlying differential survival following UVR exposure in genotypes of the water flea Daphnia melanica derived from natural ponds of differing UVR intensity. The UVR tolerance of a D. melanica genotype from a high-UVR habitat depended on the presence of visible and UV-A light wavelengths necessary for photoenzymatic repair of DNA damage, a repair pathway widely shared across the tree of life. We then measured the acquisition and repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, the primary form of UVR-caused DNA damage, in D. melanica DNA following experimental UVR exposure. We demonstrate that genotypes from high-UVR habitats repair DNA damage faster than genotypes from low-UVR habitats in the presence of visible and UV-A radiation necessary for photoenzymatic repair, but not in dark treatments. Because differences in repair rate only occurred in the presence of visible and UV-A radiation, we conclude that differing rates of DNA repair, and therefore differential UVR tolerance, are a consequence of variation in photoenzymatic repair efficiency. We then rule out a simple gene expression hypothesis for the molecular basis of differing repair efficiency, as expression of the CPD photolyase gene photorepair did not differ among D. melanica lineages, in both the presence and absence of UVR.",2015-12,2/8/16 18:55,2/8/16 18:58,,6177-87,,,24,,Mol Ecol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,"<p>Miner, Brooks E<br/>Kulling, Paige M<br/>Beer, Karlyn D<br/>Kerr, Benjamin<br/>England<br/>Mol Ecol. 2015 Dec;24(24):6177-87. doi: 10.1111/mec.13460.

Subtelomeric DNA is characterized by the presence of specific repeated segments that serve to propagate silencing or to protect chromosomal regions from spreading epigenetic control. In this study, analysis of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression data, suggests that several yeast transcription factors regulate subtelomeric silencing in response to various environmental stimuli through conditional association with proto-silencing regions called X elements. In this context, Oaf1p, Rox1p, Gzf1p and Phd1p control the propagation of silencing toward centromeres in response to stimuli affecting stress responses and metabolism, whereas others, including Adr1p, Yap5p and Msn4p, appear to influence boundaries of silencing, regulating telomere-proximal genes in Yâ€°Ã›Âª elements. The factors implicated here are known to control adjacent genes at intrachromosomal positions, suggesting their dual functionality. This study reveals a path for the coordination of subtelomeric silencing with cellular environment, and with activities of other cellular processes.",1/4/11,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,455,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that despite their long tenure in the laboratory, model organisms retain ""ecological memory"" of complex environmental changes. We have discovered that Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1, a halophilic archaeon that dominates microbial communities in a dynamically changing hypersaline environment, simultaneously optimizes fitness to total salinity, NaCl concentration, and [K]:[Mg] ratio. Despite being maintained in controlled conditions over the last 50 years, peaks in the three-dimensional fitness landscape occur in salinity and ionic compositions that are not replicated in laboratory culturing but routinely observed in the natural hypersaline environment of this organism. Intriguingly, adaptation to variations in ion composition was associated with differential regulation of anaerobic metabolism genes, suggesting an intertwined relationship among responses to oxygen and salinity. Our results suggest that the ecological memory of complex environmental variations is imprinted in the networks for coordinating multiple cellular processes. These coordination networks are also essential for dealing with changes in other physiochemically-linked factors present during routine laboratory culturing, and hence retained in model organisms.",1/10/14,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attempts have been made to employ extinction therapy, which is aimed at attenuating the incentive motivational effects of cocaine cues, as a treatment for cocaine addiction; however, this approach has been largely unsuccessful perhaps due to the inability to extinguish all cues associated with cocaine use while in a clinic. Recently, environmental enrichment (EE) during abstinence has been proposed as a strategy to attenuate cue-elicited cocaine craving. The present study used an animal model to examine whether the utility of extinction toward attenuating cue-elicited cocaine-seeking behavior could be enhanced by also providing EE. All rats were trained to self-administer cocaine while housed in isolated conditions and then subsequently underwent 17 days of forced abstinence, during which they were either housed in pairs or under EE and they either received daily 1-h extinction sessions or similar handling without exposure to the self-administration environment. Following this intervention period, all rats were tested for cue-elicited cocaine-seeking behavior. To examine whether effects of these interventions persist, all rats were subsequently single-housed for an additional 7-day forced abstinence period, followed by a second test for cue-elicited cocaine-seeking behavior. We found that although daily extinction training and EE each attenuated subsequent cue-elicited cocaine-seeking behavior, the combined treatment of extinction training+EE completely prevented it. However, once these interventions were discontinued, their protective effects diminished. These findings suggest that combining behavioral therapy approaches may improve outcomes; however, future work is needed to improve the longevity of these strategies beyond their implementation.",2011-01,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,595-602,,3,97,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Behavior; *Motivation; Animal; Animals; Cocaine/*administration & dosage; Male; Rats; Self Administration; Sprague-Dawley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because this is a fundamental challenge of all biological systems that execute programs in response to stimuli, we developed a generalized time-frequency analysis (TFA) framework to systematically explore the dynamical properties of biomolecular networks. Using TFA, we focused on two well-characterized yeast gene regulatory networks responsive to carbon-source shifts and a mammalian innate immune regulatory network responsive to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The networks are comprised of two different basic architectures. Dual positive and negative feedback loops make up the yeast galactose network; whereas overlapping positive and negative feed-forward loops are common to the yeast fatty-acid response network and the LPS-induced network of macrophages. TFA revealed remarkably distinct network behaviors in terms of trade-offs in responsiveness and noise suppression that are appropriately tuned to each biological response. The wild type galactose network was found to be highly responsive while the oleate network has greater noise suppression ability. The LPS network appeared more balanced, exhibiting less bias toward noise suppression or responsiveness. Exploration of the network parameter space exposed dramatic differences in system behaviors for each network. These studies highlight fundamental structural and dynamical principles that underlie each network, reveal constrained parameters of positive and negative feedback and feed-forward strengths that tune the networks appropriately for their respective biological roles, and demonstrate the general utility of the TFA approach for systems and synthetic biology.",2011-06,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e1002091,,6,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This unique instance of archaeal biosynthesis of the osmoprotectant ectoine and an unprecedented enrichment of multicopper oxidases, thioredoxin-like proteins, and transcriptional regulators points to an organism responsive to environmental cues and adapted to handling reactive copper and nitrogen species that likely derive from its distinctive biochemistry.

A large fraction of the regulatory genes predicted by the sea urchin genome project and shown in ancillary studies to be expressed in either oral or aboral ectoderm by 24 h are included, though universally expressed and pan-ectodermal regulatory genes are in general not. The loci of expression of these genes have been determined by whole mount in situ hybridization. We have carried out a global perturbation analysis in which expression of each gene was interrupted by introduction of morpholino antisense oligonucleotide, and the effects on all other genes were measured quantitatively, both by QPCR and by a new instrumental technology (NanoString Technologies nCounter Analysis System). At its current stage the network model, built in BioTapestry, includes 22 genes encoding transcription factors, 4 genes encoding known signaling ligands, and 3 genes that are yet unknown but are predicted to perform specific roles. Evidence emerged from the analysis pointing to distinctive subcircuit features observed earlier in other parts of the GRN, including a double negative transcriptional regulatory gate, and dynamic state lockdowns by feedback interactions.

Caspase-1 is activated in response to a breach of the cytosolic compartment by microbes and the process is initiated by intracellular pattern recognition receptors within inflammasomes. Listeria monocytogenes is detected in the cytosol by the NLRC4, NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes. NLRC4 is activated by flagellin, and L. monocytogenes evades NLRC4 by repressing flagellin expression. We generated an L. monocytogenes strain that was forced to express flagellin in the host cell cytosol. This strain hyperactivated Caspase-1 and was preferentially cleared via NLRC4 detection in an IL-1beta/IL-18 independent manner. We also created a strain of L. monocytogenes with forced expression of another NLRC4 agonist, PrgJ from the Type III secretion system of S. typhimurium. Forced expression of flagellin or PrgJ resulted in attenuation, yet both strains conferred protective immunity in mice against lethal challenge with L. monocytogenes.

The characteristics that predispose this family to such clinical outcomes have not been identified, although one potential candidate, the phenolic glycolipid PGL-tb, has been shown to mediate a fulminant lethal disease in mice and rabbits due to lipid-mediated immunosuppression. However, PGL-tb is not uniformly expressed throughout the Beijing lineage and may not be the only unique virulence trait associated with this family. In an attempt to define phenotypes common to all Beijing strains, we interrogated a carefully selected set of isolates representing the five extant lineages of the Beijing family. Comparison of lipid production in this set revealed that all Beijing strains accumulated large quantities of triacylglycerides in in vitro aerobic culture. This accumulation was found to be coincident with upregulation of Rv3130c, whose product was previously characterized as a triacylglyceride synthase. Rv3130c is a member of the DosR-controlled regulon of M. tuberculosis, and further examination revealed that several members of this regulon were upregulated throughout this strain family.

One such pathway is apicoplast-targeted type II fatty acid synthesis, which is essential for late liver-stage development in rodent malaria. It is likely that fatty acids synthesized in the apicoplast are ultimately incorporated into membrane phospholipids necessary for exoerythrocytic merozoite formation. We hypothesized that these synthesized fatty acids are being utilized for apicoplast-targeted phosphatidic acid synthesis, the phospholipid precursor. Phosphatidic acid is typically synthesized in a three-step reaction utilizing three enzymes: glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase. The Plasmodium genome is predicted to harbour genes for both apicoplast- and cytosol/endoplasmic reticulum-targeted phosphatidic acid synthesis.

OBJECTIVE: To test whether Mycobacterium africanum, which has lost around 68 kb compared with M. tuberculosis sensu stricto, causes less severe TB disease. DESIGN: We genotyped mycobacterial isolates and compared clinical and radiological characteristics as well as outcome data of M. africanum-infected TB patients with those infected with M. tuberculosis. RESULTS: Of 317 index cases, 301 had a mycobacterial isolate available, 290 of which had an interpretable spoligotype pattern. Of these, 110 isolates (38%) were M. africanum and 180 (62%) were M. tuberculosis. M. africanum cases had lower body mass indices (17 vs. 17.45 for M. tuberculosis-infected patients, P = 0.029) and their radiographic disease was more extensive (96% vs. 89% had at least moderately severe radiographic changes, P = 0.031).

The ability of different Francisella strains to inhibit the ability of E. coli LPS to induce a pulmonary inflammatory response, as measured by gene expression profiling, was examined to define the scope of modulation and identify of inflammatory genes/pathways that are specifically antagonized by a virulent F. tularensis infection. RESULTS: Prior aerosol exposure to F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, but not the live attenuated strain (LVS) of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica or F. novicida, significantly antagonized the transcriptional response in the lungs of infected mice exposed to aerosolized E. coli LPS. The response to E. coli LPS was not completely inhibited, suggesting that the bacteria is targeting further downstream of the TLR4 molecule. Analysis of the promotors of LPS-responsive genes that were perturbed by Type A Francisella infection identified candidate transcription factors that were potentially modulated by the bacteria, including multiple members of the forkhead transcription factor family (FoxA1, Foxa2, FoxD1, Foxd3, Foxf2, FoxI1, Fox03, Foxq1), IRF1, CEBPA, and Mef2. The annotated functional roles of the affected genes suggested that virulent Francisella infection suppressed cellular processes including mRNA processing, antiviral responses, intracellular trafficking, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Surprisingly, despite the broad overall suppression of LPS-induced genes by virulent Francisella, and contrary to what was anticipated from prior studies, Type A Francisella did not inhibit the expression of the majority of LPS-induced cytokines, nor the expression of many classic annotated inflammatory genes.

Studies have reported human pathogens to have geographically structured population genetics, some of which have been linked to ancient human migrations. However, no study has addressed the potential evolutionary consequences of such longstanding human-pathogen associations. Here, we demonstrate that the global population structure of M. tuberculosis is defined by six phylogeographical lineages, each associated with specific, sympatric human populations. In an urban cosmopolitan environment, mycobacterial lineages were much more likely to spread in sympatric than in allopatric patient populations. Tuberculosis cases that did occur in allopatric hosts disproportionately involved high-risk individuals with impaired host resistance. These observations suggest that mycobacterial lineages are adapted to particular human populations. If confirmed, our findings have important implications for tuberculosis control and vaccine development.",2/2/06,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,2869-73,,8,103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Disease Transmission; Adaptation; Genetic Variation; Genomics; Geography; Humans; Infectious; Molecular Epidemiology; Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology; Physiological; San Francisco/epidemiology; Tuberculosis/epidemiology/*microbiology/*transmission,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that the Sprn gene encodes a GPI-linked glycoprotein Shadoo (Sho), which localizes to a similar membrane environment as PrP(C) and is reduced in the brains of rodents with terminal prion disease. Here, analyses of prion-infected mice revealed that down-regulation of Sho protein was not related to Sprn mRNA abundance at any stage in prion infection. Down-regulation was robust upon propagation of a variety of prion strains in Prnp(a) and Prnp(b) mice, with the exception of the mouse-adapted BSE strain 301 V. In addition, Sho encoded by a TgSprn transgene was down-regulated to the same extent as endogenous Sho. Reduced Sho levels were not seen in a tauopathy, in chemically induced spongiform degeneration or in transgenic mice expressing the extracellular ADan amyloid peptide of familial Danish dementia. Insofar as prion-infected Prnp hemizygous mice exhibited accumulation of PrP(Sc) and down-regulation of Sho hundreds of days prior to onset of neurologic symptoms, Sho depletion can be excluded as an important trigger for clinical disease or as a simple consequence of neuronal damage. These studies instead define a disease-specific effect, and we hypothesize that membrane-associated Sho comprises a bystander substrate for processes degrading PrP(Sc). Thus, while protease-resistant PrP detected by in vitro digestion allows post mortem diagnosis, decreased levels of endogenous Sho may trace an early response to PrP(Sc) accumulation that operates in the CNS in vivo. This cellular response may offer new insights into the homeostatic mechanisms involved in detection and clearance of the misfolded proteins that drive prion disease pathogenesis.",2011-11,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e1002391,,11,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Brain/*metabolism; Down-Regulation; GPI-Linked Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics; Messenger/metabolism; Mice; Nerve Tissue Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics; Prion Diseases/*metabolism; PrPC Proteins/metabolism; PrPSc Proteins/*biosynthesis; RNA; Transgenic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that two members of the TLR family, TLR2 and TLR6, together coordinate macrophage activation by Gram-positive bacteria and the yeast cell-wall particle, zymosan. TLR6 and TLR2 both are recruited to the macrophage phagosome, where they recognize peptidoglycan, a Gram-positive pathogen component. By contrast, TLR2 recognizes another component, bacterial lipopeptide, without TLR6. The requirement for TLR cooperation is supported by the finding that TLR2 needs a partner to activate tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in macrophages. Dimerization of the cytoplasmic domain of TLR2 does not induce tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in macrophages, whereas similar dimerization of the TLR4 cytoplasmic domain does. We show that the cytoplasmic domain of TLR2 can form functional pairs with TLR6 or TLR1, and this interaction leads to cytokine induction. Thus, the cytoplasmic tails of TLRs are not functionally equivalent, with certain TLRs requiring assembly into heteromeric complexes, whereas others are active as homomeric complexes. Finally, we show that TLR6, TLR2, and TLR1 are recruited to macrophage phagosomes that contain IgG-coated erythrocytes that do not display microbial components. The data suggest that TLRs sample the contents of the phagosome independent of the nature of the contents, and can establish a combinatorial repertoire to discriminate among the large number of pathogen-associated molecular patterns found in nature.",12/5/00,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,13766-71,,25,97,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Drosophila Proteins; Animals; Base Sequence; Cell Surface/*metabolism; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; DNA Primers; Fungi/immunology/pathogenicity; Gram-Positive Bacteria/immunology/pathogenicity; Immune System/*immunology; Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Receptors; Toll-Like Receptor 1; Toll-Like Receptor 2; Toll-Like Receptor 4; Toll-Like Receptor 6; Toll-Like Receptors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found striking heterogeneity in amino acid sequences of synthetic enzymes with very similar functions, an observation that supports horizontal gene transfer rather than stepwise mutagenesis as a mechanism for capsule variation. Eight of the nine serotypes appear to be closely related both structurally and genetically, whereas serotype VIII is more distantly related. This similarity in polysaccharide structure strongly suggests that the evolutionary pressure toward antigenic variation exerted by acquired immunity is counterbalanced by a survival advantage conferred by conserved structural motifs of the GBS polysaccharides.",2005-05,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,3096-103,,5,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Genetic Variation; Bacterial Capsules/biosynthesis/*chemistry/genetics; Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism; Carbohydrate Sequence; DNA; Genetic; Gene Transfer; Horizontal; Molecular Sequence Data; Multigene Family; Phylogeny; Recombination; Sequence Analysis; Serotyping; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus agalactiae/*classification/genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that polymorphisms in Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), an adaptor protein that mediates signals from Toll-like receptors activated by mycobacteria, are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB). METHODS: We used a case-population study design in Vietnam with cord-blood control samples (n = 392) and case patients (n = 358) who had either pulmonary (n = 183) or meningeal (n = 175) TB. RESULTS: The TIRAP single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C558T was associated with increased susceptibility to TB, with a 558T allele frequency of 0.035 in control samples versus 0.074 in case patients (odds ratio [OR], 2.25; P < .001). Subgroup analysis revealed that SNP 558T was more strongly associated with susceptibility to meningeal TB (OR, 3.02; P < .001) than to pulmonary TB (OR, 1.55; P = .22). In comparison to the 558CC genotype, the 558TT genotype was associated with decreased whole-blood interleukin-6 production, which suggests that TIRAP influences disease susceptibility by modulating the inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence of an association of a TIRAP SNP with the risk of any disease and also suggest that the Toll-like receptor pathway influences susceptibility to meningeal and pulmonary TB by different immune mechanisms.",10/15/06,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,1127-34,,8,194,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group/genetics; Case-Control Studies; Female; Genetic; Humans; Interleukin-1/*genetics; Male; Meningeal/*genetics; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Polymorphism; Pulmonary/*genetics; Receptors; Toll-Like Receptors/*genetics; Tuberculosis; Vietnam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extracellular flagellin is detected by TLR5, which induces expression of proinflammatory cytokines, while flagellin within the cytosol of macrophages is detected through the Nod-like receptor (NLR) Ipaf, which activates caspase-1. In macrophages infected with Salmonella typhimurium or Legionella pneumophila, Ipaf becomes activated in response to flagellin that appears to be delivered to the cytosol via specific virulence factor transport systems (the SPI1 type III secretion system (T3SS) and the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS), respectively).

This is achieved through a variety of iron-binding proteins including transferrin and ferritin. During infection, bacteria acquire much of their iron from the host by synthesizing siderophores that scavenge iron and transport it into the pathogen. We recently demonstrated that enterochelin, a bacterial catecholate siderophore, binds to the host protein lipocalin 2 (ref. 5). Here, we show that this event is pivotal in the innate immune response to bacterial infection. Upon encountering invading bacteria the Toll-like receptors on immune cells stimulate the transcription, translation and secretion of lipocalin 2; secreted lipocalin 2 then limits bacterial growth by sequestrating the iron-laden siderophore.

To characterize the underlying intertwined gene regulatory network governed by approximately 200 transcription factors of M. tuberculosis, we have assayed the global transcriptional consequences of overexpressing each transcription factor from an inducible promoter. RESULTS: We cloned and overexpressed 206 transcription factors in M. tuberculosis to identify the regulatory signature of each. We identified 9,335 regulatory consequences of overexpressing each of 183 transcription factors, providing evidence of regulation for 70% of the M. tuberculosis genome. These transcriptional signatures agree well with previously described M. tuberculosis regulons. The number of genes differentially regulated by transcription factor overexpression varied from hundreds of genes to none, with the majority of expression changes repressing basal transcription. Exploring the global transcriptional maps of transcription factor overexpressing (TFOE) strains, we predicted and validated the phenotype of a regulator that reduces susceptibility to a first line anti-tubercular drug, isoniazid. We also combined the TFOE data with an existing model of M. tuberculosis metabolism to predict the growth rates of individual TFOE strains with high fidelity. CONCLUSION: This work has led to a systems-level framework describing the transcriptome of a devastating bacterial pathogen, characterized the transcriptional influence of nearly all individual transcription factors in M. tuberculosis, and demonstrated the utility of this resource.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have a key role in innate immunity and mutations in the genes encoding these receptors have been associated with increased or decreased susceptibility to infections. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR2-4 and TLR7-9 influenced the natural course of HIV-1 infection. METHODS: Twenty-eight SNPs in TLRs were analysed in HAART-naive HIV-positive patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. The SNPs were detected using Sequenom technology. Haplotypes were inferred using an expectation-maximization algorithm. The CD4 T cell decline was calculated using a least-squares regression. Patients with a rapid CD4 cell decline, less than the 15th percentile, were defined as rapid progressors. The risk of rapid progression associated with SNPs was estimated using a logistic regression model. Other candidate risk factors included age, sex and risk groups (heterosexual, homosexual and intravenous drug use). RESULTS: Two SNPs in TLR9 (1635A/G and +1174G/A) in linkage disequilibrium were associated with the rapid progressor phenotype: for 1635A/G, odds ratio (OR), 3.9 [95% confidence interval (CI),1.7-9.2] for GA versus AA and OR, 4.7 (95% CI,1.9-12.0) for GG versus AA (P = 0.0008). CONCLUSION: Rapid progression of HIV-1 infection was associated with TLR9 polymorphisms. Because of its potential implications for intervention strategies and vaccine developments, additional epidemiological and experimental studies are needed to confirm this association.",2/19/07,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,441-6,,4,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Hiv-1; *Polymorphism; Adult; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Cohort Studies; Disease Progression; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Haplotypes; HIV Infections/*genetics/immunology; Humans; Male; Single Nucleotide; Toll-Like Receptor 9/*genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study secondary bacterial infection following influenza virus infection, mice were inoculated with sublethal doses of 2009 seasonal H1N1 virus (NIH50) or pandemic H1N1 virus (Mex09) followed by inoculation with Streptococcus pneumoniae 48 h later. Disease was characterized by assessment of weight loss and survival, titration of virus and bacteria by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), histopathology, expression microarray, and immunohistochemistry. Mice inoculated with virus alone showed 100% survival for all groups. Mice inoculated with Mex09 plus S. pneumoniae showed severe weight loss and 100% mortality with severe alveolitis, denuded bronchiolar epithelium, and widespread expression of apoptosis marker cleaved caspase 3. In contrast, mice inoculated with NIH50 plus S. pneumoniae showed increased weight loss, 100% survival, and slightly enhanced lung pathology. Mex09-S. pneumoniae coinfection also resulted in increased S. pneumoniae replication in lung and bacteremia late in infection. Global gene expression profiling revealed that Mex09-S. pneumoniae coinfection did not induce significantly more severe inflammatory responses but featured significant loss of epithelial cell reproliferation and repair responses. Histopathological examination for cell proliferation marker MCM7 showed significant staining of airway epithelial cells in all groups except Mex09-S. pneumoniae-infected mice. This study demonstrates that secondary bacterial infection during 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus infection resulted in more severe disease and loss of lung repair responses than did seasonal influenza viral and bacterial coinfection. Moreover, this study provides novel insights into influenza virus and bacterial coinfection by showing correlation of lethal outcome with loss of airway basal epithelial cells and associated lung repair responses. IMPORTANCE: Secondary bacterial pneumonias lead to increased disease severity and have resulted in a significant percentage of deaths during influenza pandemics. To understand the biological basis for the interaction of bacterial and viral infections, mice were infected with sublethal doses of 2009 seasonal H1N1 and pandemic H1N1 viruses followed by infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae 48 h later. Only infection with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and S. pneumoniae resulted in severe disease with a 100% fatality rate. Analysis of the host response to infection during lethal coinfection showed a significant loss of responses associated with lung repair that was not observed in any of the other experimental groups. This group of mice also showed enhanced bacterial replication in the lung. This study reveals that the extent of lung damage during viral infection influences the severity of secondary bacterial infections and may help explain some differences in mortality during influenza pandemics.",2011,2/5/16 22:14,2/9/16 0:19,,,,5,2,,MBio,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 21933918 PMCID: PMC3175626,,,,,"Animals; Coinfection; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza, Human; Lung; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Pandemics; Pneumococcal Infections; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Virulence; Weight Loss",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After identifying differentially expressed genes, we confirmed these results in 34 additional subjects by real-time PCR. We also used a case-control study design to examine whether polymorphisms in differentially regulated genes were associated with susceptibility to these different clinical forms of TB. We compared gene expression profiles in Mtb-stimulated and unstimulated macrophages and identified 1,608 and 199 genes that were differentially expressed by >2- and >5-fold, respectively. In an independent sample set of 34 individuals and a subset of highly regulated genes, 90% of the microarray results were confirmed by RT-PCR, including expression levels of CCL1, which distinguished the 3 clinical groups. Furthermore, 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CCL1 were found to be associated with TB in a case-control genetic association study with 273 TB cases and 188 controls. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of CCL1 as a gene involved in host susceptibility to TB and the first study to combine microarray and DNA polymorphism studies to identify genes associated with TB susceptibility.

Remodeling of the transcriptome requires both altering the transcription rate and clearing away the existing mRNA through degradation, a process that can be directly regulated in response to stress. To understand better how MTB adapts to the harsh environs of the human host, we performed a global survey of the decay rates of MTB mRNA transcripts. Decay rates were measured for 2139 of the approximately 4000 MTB genes, which displayed an average half-life of 9.5 min. This is nearly twice the average mRNA half-life of other prokaryotic organisms where these measurements have been made.

The generally stable transcriptome described here, and the additional stabilization in response to physiologically relevant stresses, has far-ranging implications for how this pathogen is able to adapt in its human host.",11/3/12,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the pathway of macrophage activation during murine Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) infection. Three distinct phenotypes of macrophages were identified and compared: resident peritoneal macrophages, day 2 postinfection macrophages, and 12-day postinfection macrophages. Compared with resident peritoneal macrophages, day 2 BCG macrophages expressed intermediate levels of the cell surface receptors Mac1 and F4/80 and low levels of MHC class II molecules. These cells were highly phagocytic and produced large amounts of mRNA encoding the chemokine IP-10. In addition, day 2 BCG macrophages did not generate reactive nitrogen intermediates, though they were primed to do so, and did not have increased levels of TNF-alpha mRNA. Blockade of monocyte influx into the peritoneal cavity using Abs to platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 had no effect on the appearance of day 2 BCG macrophages, suggesting this cell can differentiate from resident peritoneal macrophages. In contrast to day 2 BCG macrophages, day 12 BCG macrophages were poorly phagocytic, but produced high levels of reactive nitrogen intermediates, IP-10 and TNF-alpha mRNA, and class II MHC molecules. We propose that day 2 BCG macrophages are specialized for phagocytic uptake of pathogens from the extracellular space, whereas day 12 BCG macrophages are specialized for killing of the internalized pathogens.

We show here that two other RNA viruses, EMCV and VSV, activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in dendritic cells and macrophages through a mechanism requiring viral replication. Inflammasome activation in response to both viruses does not require MDA5 or RIG-I signaling. Despite the ability of the NLRP3 inflammasome to detect EMCV and VSV, wild type and Caspase-1 deficient mice were equally susceptible to infection with both viruses.

Dengue infection induces drastic rearrangement of host endoplasmic reticulum membranes into complex membranous structures housing replication complexes; the contribution(s) of host proteins and pathways to this process is poorly understood but is likely to be mediated by protein-protein interactions. We have developed an approach for obtaining high confidence protein-protein interaction data by employing affinity tags and quantitative proteomics, in the context of viral infection, followed by robust statistical analysis. Using this approach, we identified high confidence interactors of NS5, the viral polymerase, and NS3, the helicase/protease. Quantitative proteomics allowed us to exclude a large number of presumably nonspecific interactors from our datasets and imparted a high level of confidence to our resulting datasets. We identified 53 host proteins reproducibly associated with NS5 and 41 with NS3, with 13 of these candidates present in both datasets. The host factors identified have diverse functions, including retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum transport, biosynthesis of long-chain fatty-acyl-coenzyme As, and in the unfolded protein response. We selected GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor responsible for ARF activation, from the NS5 dataset for follow up and functional validation. We show that GBF1 plays a critical role early in dengue infection that is independent of its role in the maintenance of Golgi structure.

Candida enters the blood stream and disseminate throughout the body and it is often observed in hospitalized patients, immunocompromised individuals or those with chronic diseases. This infection is opportunistic and risk starts with the colonization of C. albicans on mucocutaneous surfaces and respiratory epithelium. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which are involved in the regulation of virtually every cellular process. They regulate and control the levels of mRNA stability and post-transcriptional gene expression. Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been associated in many disease states, and miRNA-based therapies are in progress. In this study, we investigated possible variations of miRNA expression profiles of respiratory epithelial cells infected by invasive Candida species. For this purpose, respiratory epithelial tissues of infected individuals from hospital laboratory were accessed before their treatment. Invasive Candida infection was confirmed by isolation of Candia albicans from the blood cultures of the same infected individuals. The purity of epithelial tissues was assessed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur cytometer; BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) using statin antibody (S-44). TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR (in a TaqMan Low Density Array format) was used for miRNA expression profiling. MiRNAs investigated, the levels of expression of 55 miRNA were significantly altered in infected tissues. Some miRNAs showed dramatic increase (miR-16-1) or decrease of expression (miR-17-3p) as compared to control. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of these miRNA-targeted genes suggests that Candidal infection affect many important biological pathways. In summary, disturbance in miRNA expression levels indicated the change in cascade of pathological processes and the regulation of respiratory epithelial functions following invasive Candidal infection.

However, its effect on tuberculosis transmission in populations with moderate rates of drug-resistant disease is not known. METHODS: This population-based prospective study in southern Mexico between March, 1995, and February, 2000, was based on passive case finding and detection of acid-fast bacilli in sputum samples to diagnose pulmonary tuberculosis. We also used cultures, drug-susceptibility testing, bacterial genotyping, and monitoring of treatment outcomes. FINDINGS: We enrolled 436 patients; the HIV seroprevalence rate was 2%. We used three indicators to monitor continuing tuberculosis transmission: the incidence rate of pulmonary tuberculosis, which decreased by 54.4% between 1995 and 2000, from 42.1 to 19.2 per 10(5) population (p=0.00048); the percentage of clustered pulmonary tuberculosis cases, which decreased by 62.6% from 22% to 8% (p=0.02); and the rate of primary drug resistance, which decreased by 84.0% from 9.4 to 1.5 per 10(5) population (p=0.004). Rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis also decreased (p<0.0001). The case-fatality ratio was 12% for MDR tuberculosis (five of 41), 7% for strains resistant to at least one drug after exclusion of MDR (four of 55), and 3% for pansusceptible strains (nine of 272). There were 13 treatment failures (11%) in 1995 and one (2%) in 2000 (p=0.012). INTERPRETATION: Even in settings with moderate rates of MDR tuberculosis, DOTS can rapidly reduce the transmission and incidence of both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis. However, further interventions, such as drug-susceptibility testing and standardised or individualised treatment regimens, are needed to reduce mortality rates for MDR tuberculosis.",4/2/05,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,1239-45,,9466,365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Directly Observed Therapy; control; Humans; Incidence; Mexico/epidemiology; Multidrug-Resistant/*drug therapy/epidemiology/prevention &; Pulmonary/*drug therapy/epidemiology/prevention & control; Tuberculosis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A TB â€°Ã›Âªepisodeâ€°Ã›Âª was defined as the period of time between bacteriological diagnosis and treatment discharge by the local control programme. Distances of TB episodes from the nearest urban centre were determined according to recent transmission and multidrug resistance (MDR). RESULTS: During the first half of the study period, MDR episodes were located a median distance of 1.24 km from urban centres, which did not differ significantly from non-MDR episodes (1.14 km, P=0.56). In contrast, the median distance of MDR episodes increased 55% to 1.92 km during the second half, which placed them significantly further away out than non-MDR episodes (1.08 km, P=0.01). No changes in location were detected for recent transmission. CONCLUSION: While reinforcing the TB control programme reduced the incidence of MDR, the remaining episodes were located in poorer and more remote areas.",2005-04,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,305-11,,4,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Antitubercular Agents/therapeutic use; Bacterial; Drug Resistance; Female; Government Programs; Humans; Male; Mexico/epidemiology; Multidrug-Resistant/epidemiology; Multiple; Mycobacterium tuberculosis/drug effects; Program Evaluation; Tuberculosis; Tuberculosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology/prevention & control; Urban Health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They identified 527 genes (15 % of those tested) that are variably expressed among the isolates studied. The remaining genes were divided into three categories based on their expression levels: unexpressed (38 %), low to undetectable expression (31 %) and consistently expressed (16 %). The expression categories were compared with functional categories and three biologically interesting gene lists: genes that are deleted among clinical isolates, T-cell antigens and essential genes. There were significant associations between expression variability and the classification of genes as T-cell antigens, involved in lipid metabolism, PE/PPE, insertion sequences and phages, and deleted among clinical isolates.

To determine if reactive oxygen species produced by host inflammatory responses play a central role in promoting severity of lung pathology, we treated 1918 influenza virus-infected mice with the catalytic catalase/superoxide dismutase mimetic, salen-manganese complex EUK-207 beginning 3 days postinfection. Postexposure treatment of mice infected with a lethal dose of the 1918 influenza virus with EUK-207 resulted in significantly increased survival and reduced lung pathology without a reduction in viral titers. In vitro studies also showed that EUK-207 treatment did not affect 1918 influenza viral replication.

We show that some of these LSPs are unique event polymorphisms that can be used to define and subdivide the Beijing/W family. One LSP (RD105) was seen in all Beijing/W strains and thus serves as a useful marker for the identification of this family of strains. Additional LSPs (RD142, RD150, and RD181) further divided this family into four monophyletic subgroups, demonstrating a deeper population structure than previously appreciated.

Although pathogens are typically recognized by multiple TLRs, the specific roles of individual TLRs in mediating host protection during in vivo infection are not well understood. METHODS: We compared the roles of myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MyD88), which regulates signaling through multiple TLRs, and TLR2 in mediating resistance to aerosolized Legionella pneumophila infection in vivo. RESULTS: In comparison with wild-type mice, MyD88-deficient (MyD88(-/-)) mice had dramatically higher bacterial counts in the lungs, with decreased neutrophil counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as absent cytokine and chemokine production at early time points. By day 6 of infection, the MyD88(-/-) mice developed organizing pneumonia with dissemination of L. pneumophila to the lymph nodes and spleen. TLR2(-/-) mice were also more susceptible to L. pneumophila, with higher bacterial counts in the lung. However, TLR2(-/-) mice produced proinflammatory cytokines, recruited neutrophils to the lung alveoli, and cleared the infection without progression to organizing pneumonia and disseminated disease. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a MyD88-dependent pathway is required for eradication of L. pneumophila and prevention of organizing pneumonia.

The macrophage responds to L. monocytogenes through detection pathways located on the cell surface (TLRs) and within the cytosol (Nod-like receptors) to promote inflammatory processes aimed at clearing the pathogen. Cytosolic L. monocytogenes activates caspase 1, resulting in post-translational processing of the cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18 as well as caspase 1-dependent cell death (pyroptosis). We demonstrate that the presence of L. monocytogenes within the cytosolic compartment induces caspase 1 activation through multiple Nod-like receptors, including Ipaf and Nalp3. Flagellin expression by cytosolic L. monocytogenes was detected through Ipaf in a dose-dependent manner. Concordantly, detection of flagellin promoted bacterial clearance in a murine infection model.

HIV-1 binding and fusion with the DC membrane results in low level de novo infection that can also be transferred to T lymphocytes at a later stage. We have previously reported that HIV-1 can induce partial maturation of iMDDCs at both stages of trafficking. Here we show that CD45â€°ÂÂ¼ microvesicles (MV) which contaminate purified HIV-1 inocula due to similar size and density, affect DC maturation, de novo HIV-1 infection and transfer to T lymphocytes. Comparing iMDDCs infected with CD45-depleted HIV-1BaL or matched non-depleted preparations, the presence of CD45â€°ÂÂ¼ MVs was shown to enhance DC maturation and ICAM-1 (CD54) expression, which is involved in DCâ€°Ã¶Â¦T lymphocyte interactions, while restricting HIV-1 infection of MDDCs. Furthermore, in the DC culture HIV-1 infected (p24â€°ÂÂ¼) MDDCs were more mature than bystander cells. Depletion of MVs from the HIV-1 inoculum markedly inhibited DCâ€°Ã¶Â¦T lymphocyte clustering and the induction of alloproliferation as well as limiting HIV-1 transfer from DCs to T lymphocytes. The effects of MV depletion on these functions were reversed by the re-addition of purified MVs from activated but not non-activated SUPT1.CCR5-CL.30 or primary T cells. Analysis of the protein complement of these MVs and of these HIV-1 inocula before and after MV depletion showed that Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) and nef were the likely DC maturation candidates. Recombinant HSP90Ã«Â± and Ã«_ and nef all induced DC maturation and ICAM-1 expression, greater when combined.

In order to further monitor the outbreak following its peak in 2003, Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from all new King County tuberculosis (TB) patients in 2004 and the first half of 2005 (n = 220) were genotyped by using a rapid comparative genomics-based (genomic deletion-typing) approach, with confirmation by mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units and repetitive-sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR). Results were compared to retrospective genotypic data from 1995 to 2003. The outbreak strain SBRI9, which was not seen among King County homeless persons prior to 2002, accounted for 16 out of 30 TB cases (53%) within this population in 2002. This trend continued with 27 out of 35 cases (77%) caused by the outbreak strain in 2003, 11 out of 13 cases (85%) caused by the outbreak strain in 2004, and 4 out of 10 cases (40%) caused by the outbreak strain in the first 5 months of 2005. Thus, the outbreak strain remained well established within this homeless population throughout the study period. At least four SBRI9 cases were in people who had previously been infected by other strains. The novel PCR-based strain-typing approach used in this investigation proved to be cost-effective and very rapid. In most cases, it was possible to analyze DNA extracted directly from primary isolation (Mycobacterium growth indicator tube) cultures submitted by clinical laboratories, a feature that markedly reduced the delay between diagnosis and strain typing results. This rapid turnaround facilitated public health efforts to prevent new outbreaks involving this strain.",2005-11,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,5550-4,,11,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Disease Outbreaks; Bacterial; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Gene Deletion; Genome; Homeless Persons; Humans; Molecular Epidemiology; Mycobacterium tuberculosis/classification/*genetics; Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods; Retrospective Studies; Species Specificity; Tuberculosis/*epidemiology; United States/epidemiology; Urban Population,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The World Health Organization has encouraged gender specific comparisons in TB rates to determine whether women with TB are less likely than men with TB to be diagnosed, reported, and treated. A study was undertaken to identify gender based differences in patients with pulmonary TB and to use this information to improve TB control efforts. METHODS: Individuals with a cough for more than 2 weeks in southern Mexico were screened from March 1995 to April 2003. Clinical and mycobacteriological information (isolation, identification, drug susceptibility testing and IS6110 based genotyping, and spoligotyping) was collected from those with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB. Patients were treated in accordance with official norms and followed to ascertain treatment outcome, retreatment, and vital status. RESULTS: 623 patients with pulmonary TB were enrolled. The male:female incidence rate ratio for overall, reactivated, and recently transmitted disease was 1.58 (95% CI 1.34 to 1.86), 1.64 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.98), and 1.41 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.96), respectively. Men were more likely than women to default from treatment (adjusted OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.46 to 7.43), to be retreated (hazard ratio (HR) 3.15, 95% CI 1.38 to 7.22), and to die from TB (HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.99). CONCLUSIONS: Higher rates of transmitted and reactivated disease and poorer treatment outcomes among men are indicators of gender differentials in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary TB, and suggest specific strategies in endemic settings.",2006-04,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,348-53,,4,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Sex Factors; Endemic Diseases/*statistics & numerical data; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Humans; Male; Mexico/epidemiology; Pulmonary/epidemiology/microbiology/*transmission; Sex Distribution; Sputum/microbiology; Treatment Outcome; Tuberculosis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-infected mice exhibited markedly more severe disease, shortened survival time and more severe lung pathology, including widespread thrombi. Transcriptional profiling revealed activation of coagulation only in co-infected mice, consistent with the extensive thrombogenesis observed. Immunohistochemistry showed extensive expression of tissue factor (F3) and prominent deposition of neutrophil elastase on endothelial and epithelial cells in co-infected mice. Lung sections of SP-positive 1918 autopsy cases showed extensive thrombi and prominent staining for F3 in alveolar macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, endothelial and epithelial cells, in contrast to co-infection-positive 2009 pandemic H1N1 autopsy cases. This study reveals that a distinctive feature of 1918 influenza virus and SP co-infection in mice and humans is extensive expression of tissue factor and activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway leading to widespread pulmonary thrombosis.

We surveyed sequence diversity within a global collection of strains belonging to MTBC using seven megabase pairs of DNA sequence data. We show that the members of MTBC affecting humans are more genetically diverse than generally assumed, and that this diversity can be linked to human demographic and migratory events. We further demonstrate that these organisms are under extremely reduced purifying selection and that, as a result of increased genetic drift, much of this genetic diversity is likely to have functional consequences.

Dissemination is believed to occur early during infection, before the development of adaptive immunity. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mediates recognition of M. tuberculosis and initiates the innate immune response to infection. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in the TLR2 gene influence bacterial dissemination and the development of TBM. A case-control study was designed to test the hypothesis. Cases of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) (n=183) and TBM (n=175), and cord blood controls (n=389) were enrolled in Vietnam. TLR2 genotype 597CC was associated with susceptibility to TB (odds ratio (OR)=2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-3.99).

METHODS: We genotyped mycobacterial isolates obtained from a study of patients with tuberculosis and their household contacts and compared T cell responses and tuberculin skin test results by infecting genotype. RESULTS: The T cell response to early secreted antigenic target, 6 kDa (ESAT-6), was attenuated in patients with tuberculosis (odds ratio [OR], 0.41 [95% confidence interval CI, 0.19-0.89]; P = .024) and household contacts (OR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.38-0.83]; P = .004) infected with M. africanum, compared with the response in those infected with M. tuberculosis. In these same groups, responses to culture filtrate protein, 10 kDa (CFP-10), were nonsignificantly attenuated (P = .22 and P = .16, respectively), as were tuberculin skin test results (P = .30 and P = .46, respectively). Sequencing of region of difference 1 of M. africanum revealed that Rv3879c is a pseudogene in M. africanum; however, this finding does not provide an obvious mechanism for the attenuated ESAT-6 response. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence, to our knowledge, that strain differences affect interferon- gamma -based T cell responses.

The reduction in mortality and morbidity in statin-treated patients is incompletely explained by their effects on cholesterol, and an anti-inflammatory role for the drug has been proposed. We report in this work that, unexpectedly, simvastatin enhances LPS-induced IL-12p40 production by murine macrophages, and that it does so by activating the IL-12p40 promoter. Mutational analysis and dominant-negative expression studies indicate that both C/EBP and AP-1 transcription factors have a crucial role in promoter activation. This occurs via a c-Fos- and c-Jun-based mechanism; we demonstrate that ectopic expression of c-Jun activates the IL-12p40 promoter, whereas expression of c-Fos inhibits IL-12p40 promoter activity. Simvastatin prevents LPS-induced c-Fos expression, thereby relieving the inhibitory effect of c-Fos on the IL-12p40 promoter. Concomitantly, simvastatin induces the phosphorylation of c-Jun by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, resulting in c-Jun-dependent activation of the IL-12p40 promoter. This appears to be a general mechanism because simvastatin also augments LPS-dependent activation of the TNF-alpha promoter, perhaps because the TNF-alpha promoter has C/EBP and AP-1 binding sites in a similar configuration to the IL-12p40 promoter. The fact that simvastatin potently augments LPS-induced IL-12p40 and TNF-alpha production has implications for the treatment of bacterial infections in statin-treated patients.",6/15/04,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,7377-84,,12,172,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adjuvants; Animals; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/physiology; Drug Synergism; Female; Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*immunology; Genetic/drug effects; Immunologic/pharmacology; Inbred C57BL; Inflammation/*chemically induced; Interleukin-12/biosynthesis; Interleukin-12 Subunit p40; Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology; Macrophages/drug effects/*immunology; Mice; Promoter Regions; Protein Subunits/biosynthesis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics/physiology; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/physiology; Simvastatin/*pharmacology; Transcription Factor AP-1/physiology; Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice, TNF-alpha production in response to M. leprae was essentially absent in TLR2-deficient macrophages. Similarly, human TLR2 mediated M. leprae-dependent activation of NF-kappaB in transfected Chinese hamster ovary and human embryonic kidney 293 cells, with enhancement of this signaling in the presence of CD14. In contrast, activation of NF-kappaB by human TLR2Arg(677)Trp was abolished in response to M. leprae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

We examined the role of TLR5 during the murine response to aerosolized Lp infection. At 4 h after infection, Tlr5(-/-) mice had lower numbers of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in their broncho-alveolar lavage fluid in comparison to wild-type (WT) mice. At 24 and 72 h, the PMN recruitment was similar. WT mice infected with a flagellin-deficient strain (LpFlaA-) also showed an impaired early PMN response at 4 h compared with those infected with the WT strain. There was no consistent difference in bacterial counts at any of the time points when comparing the Tlr5(-/-) and WT mice. However, at 6 days after infection, the Tlr5(-/-) mice had increased leukocytic infiltrates in the alveolar and peribronchial interstitial spaces that were consistent with organizing pneumonia. We also examined the role of TLR5 during macrophage infection. In contrast to bone marrow-derived macrophages, AMs secreted TNF-alpha after stimulation with purified flagellin. In addition, WT, but not Tlr5(-/-), AMs produced TNF-alpha after stimulation with Lp. Live LpFlaA- did not induce TNF-alpha secretion in AM.

This proteolysis is dependent upon caspase 1, which is activated by Nod-like receptor (NLR) signaling. NLRC4 (previously named Ipaf) activates caspase 1 in response to bacterial virulence factors including type III and IV secretion systems (T3SS and T4SS).

However, the role of other post-translational modifications, such as ADP-ribosylation, in host-virus interactions is less well characterized. ADP-ribosylation is carried out by proteins encoded by the PARP (also called ARTD) gene family. The majority of the 17 human PARP genes are poorly characterized. However, one PARP protein, PARP13/ZAP, has broad antiviral activity and has evolved under positive (diversifying) selection in primates. Such evolution is typical of domains that are locked in antagonistic â€°Ã›Âªarms racesâ€°Ã›Âª with viral factors. To identify additional PARP genes that may be involved in host-virus interactions, we performed evolutionary analyses on all primate PARP genes to search for signatures of rapid evolution. Contrary to expectations that most PARP genes are involved in â€°Ã›Âªhousekeepingâ€°Ã›Âª functions, we found that nearly one-third of PARP genes are evolving under strong recurrent positive selection. We identified a >300 amino acid disordered region of PARP4, a component of cytoplasmic vault structures, to be rapidly evolving in several mammalian lineages, suggesting this region serves as an important host-pathogen specificity interface. We also found positive selection of PARP9, 14 and 15, the only three human genes that contain both PARP domains and macrodomains. Macrodomains uniquely recognize, and in some cases can reverse, protein mono-ADP-ribosylation, and we observed strong signatures of recurrent positive selection throughout the macro-PARP macrodomains. Furthermore, PARP14 and PARP15 have undergone repeated rounds of gene birth and loss during vertebrate evolution, consistent with recurrent gene innovation. Together with previous studies that implicated several PARPs in immunity, as well as those that demonstrated a role for virally encoded macrodomains in host immune evasion, our evolutionary analyses suggest that addition, recognition and removal of ADP-ribosylation is a critical, underappreciated currency in host-virus conflicts.",2014-05,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e1004403,,5,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viral nuclear import antagonists, expressed by several highly pathogenic RNA viruses, likely mediate pleiotropic effects on host gene expression, presumably interfering with transcription factors, cytokines, hormones, and/or signaling cascades that occur in response to infection. By bioinformatic and systems biology approaches, we evaluated the impact of nuclear import antagonism on host expression networks by using human lung epithelial cells infected with either wild-type virus or a mutant that does not express ORF6 protein. Microarray analysis revealed significant changes in differential gene expression, with approximately twice as many upregulated genes in the mutant virus samples by 48 h postinfection, despite identical viral titers. Our data demonstrated that ORF6 protein expression attenuates the activity of numerous karyopherin-dependent host transcription factors (VDR, CREB1, SMAD4, p53, EpasI, and Oct3/4) that are critical for establishing antiviral responses and regulating key host responses during virus infection. Results were confirmed by proteomic and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay analyses and in parallel microarray studies using infected primary human airway epithelial cell cultures. The data strongly support the hypothesis that viral antagonists of nuclear import actively manipulate host responses in specific hierarchical patterns, contributing to the viral pathogenic potential in vivo. Importantly, these studies and modeling approaches not only provide templates for evaluating virus antagonism of nuclear import processes but also can reveal candidate cellular genes and pathways that may significantly influence disease outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in vivo.",2013-04,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,3885-902,,7,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active Transport; Cell Nucleus/physiology; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Computational Biology/methods; DNA Primers/genetics; Epithelial Cells/metabolism/virology; Gene Regulatory Networks/*physiology; Genetic/*physiology; Humans; Lung/cytology; Microarray Analysis; Proteomics; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; SARS Virus/*metabolism; Signal Transduction/*physiology; Systems Biology/methods; Transcription; Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/*metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These extreme pathways span a convex, high-dimensional space that circumscribes all potential steady-state flux distributions achievable by the defined metabolic network. Genome-scale extreme pathways associated with the production of non-essential amino acids in Haemophilus influenzae were computed. They offer valuable insight into the functioning of its metabolic network. Three key results were obtained. First, there were multiple internal flux maps corresponding to externally indistinguishable states. It was shown that there was an average of 37 internal states per unique exchange flux vector in H. influenzae when the network was used to produce a single amino acid while allowing carbon dioxide and acetate as carbon sinks. With the inclusion of succinate as an additional output, this ratio increased to 52, a 40% increase. Second, an analysis of the carbon fates illustrated that the extreme pathways were non-uniformly distributed across the carbon fate spectrum. In the detailed case study, 45% of the distinct carbon fate values associated with lysine production represented 85% of the extreme pathways. Third, this distribution fell between distinct systemic constraints. For lysine production, the carbon fate values that represented 85% of the pathways described above corresponded to only 2 distinct ratios of 1:1 and 4:1 between carbon dioxide and acetate. The present study analysed single outputs from one organism, and provides a start to genome-scale extreme pathways studies.

The 1918 pandemic influenza virus has an avian influenza virus-like genome, and its H1 hemagglutinin was identified as a key mammalian virulence factor. A chimeric 1918 virus expressing a contemporary avian H1 hemagglutinin, however, displayed murine pathogenicity indistinguishable from that of the 1918 virus. Here, isogenic chimeric avian influenza viruses were constructed on an avian influenza virus backbone, differing only by hemagglutinin subtype expressed. Viruses expressing the avian H1, H6, H7, H10, and H15 subtypes were pathogenic in mice and cytopathic in normal human bronchial epithelial cells, in contrast to H2-, H3-, H5-, H9-, H11-, H13-, H14-, and H16-expressing viruses. Mouse pathogenicity was associated with pulmonary macrophage and neutrophil recruitment. These data suggest that avian influenza virus hemagglutinins H1, H6, H7, H10, and H15 contain inherent mammalian virulence factors and likely share a key virulence property of the 1918 virus. Consequently, zoonotic infections with avian influenza viruses bearing one of these hemagglutinins may cause enhanced disease in mammals. IMPORTANCE: Influenza viruses from birds can cause outbreaks in humans and may contribute to the development of pandemics. The 1918 pandemic influenza virus has an avian influenza virus-like genome, and its main surface protein, an H1 subtype hemagglutinin, was identified as a key mammalian virulence factor. In a previous study, a 1918 virus expressing an avian H1 gene was as virulent in mice as the reconstructed 1918 virus. Here, a set of avian influenza viruses was constructed, differing only by hemagglutinin subtype.

It has been suggested that HIV-1E is derived from a recombinant lineage of subtype A (HIV-1A) and subtype E, with multiple breakpoints along the E genome. We obtained complete genome sequences of clade E viruses from Thailand (93TH057 and 93TH065) and from the Central African Republic (90CF11697 and 90CF4071), increasing the total number of HIV-1E complete genome sequences available to seven. Phylogenetic analysis of complete genomes showed that subtypes A and E are themselves monophyletic, although together they also form a larger monophyletic group. The apparent phylogenetic incongruence at different regions of the genome that was previously taken as evidence of recombination is shown to be not statistically significant. Furthermore, simulations indicate that bootscanning and pairwise distance results, previously used as evidence for recombination, can be misleading, particularly when there are differences in substitution or evolutionary rates across the genomes of different subtypes. Taken jointly, our analyses suggest that there is inadequate support for the hypothesis that subtype E variants are derived from a recombinant lineage. In contrast, many other HIV strains claimed to have a recombinant origin, including viruses for which only a single parental strain was employed for analysis, do indeed satisfy the statistical criteria we propose. Thus, while intersubtype recombinant HIV strains are indeed circulating, the criteria for assigning a recombinant origin to viral structures should include statistical testing of alternative hypotheses to avoid inappropriate assignments that would obscure the true evolutionary properties of these viruses.",2000-11,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,10752-65,,22,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DNA; Evolution; Genetic; HIV-1/ classification/ genetics; HIV Infections/ virology; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Recombination; Sequence Analysis; Terminology as Topic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maximum likelihood methods of simultaneously constructing phylogenetic tree topologies and estimating model parameters are computationally intensive, and are not feasible for sample sizes of 25 or greater using personal computers. Techniques that initially construct a tree topology and then use this non-maximized topology to estimate ML substitution rates, however, can quickly arrive at a model of sequence evolution. The accuracy of this two-step estimation technique was tested using simulated data sets with known model parameters. The results showed that for a star-like topology, as is often seen in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype B sequences, a random starting topology could produce nucleotide substitution rates that were not statistically different than the true rates. Samples were isolated from 100 HIV-1 subtype B infected individuals from the United States and a 620 nt region of the env gene was sequenced for each sample. The sequence data were used to obtain a substitution model of sequence evolution specific for HIV-1 subtype B env by estimating nucleotide substitution rates and the site-to-site heterogeneity in 100 individuals from the United States.

A combination of longitudinal, dimensionality reduction and categorical analysis of the transcriptome from 111 liver biopsy specimens taken from 57 HCV-infected patients over time identified a molecular signature of gene expression of patients at risk of developing severe fibrosis. Significantly, alterations in gene expression occur before histologic evidence of liver disease progression, suggesting that events that occur during the acute phase of infection influence patient outcome.

Exogenous gangliosides suppressed FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity and binding of FliC to Caco-2 cells. Incorporation of exogenous ganglioside GD1a into Caco-2 cell membranes increased the effect of FliC on hBD-2 promoter activity. In support of a role for endogenous gangliosides, incubation of Caco-2 cells with dl-threo-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-phenylpropanol, a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, reduced FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity. GD1a-loaded CHO-K1-expressing TLR5 cells had a higher potential for hBD-2 induction following FliC stimulation than GD1a-loaded CHO-K1 cells not expressing TLR5. FliC increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, p38, and ERK1/2. Exogenous gangliosides GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b each suppressed FliC induction of p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, FliC did not enhance luciferase activity in Caco-2 cells transfected with a plasmid containing a mutated activator protein 1-binding site. These results suggest that gangliosides act as co-receptors with TLR5 for FliC and promote hBD-2 expression via mitogen-activated protein kinase.",3/26/04,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,12213-9,,13,279,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; beta-Defensins/*metabolism; Binding Sites; Blotting; Caco-2 Cells; Cell Surface/metabolism; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; Dose-Response Relationship; Drug; Flagellin/*metabolism; Flow Cytometry; Genetic; Glucosyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors; G(M1) Ganglioside/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry; Humans; Immunologic; Luciferases/metabolism; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism; Messenger/metabolism; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism; Models; Morpholines/chemistry; Mutation; Phosphorylation; Plasmids/metabolism; Promoter Regions; Protein Binding; Receptors; RNA; Salmonella enteritidis/*metabolism; Signal Transduction; Toll-Like Receptor 5; Toll-Like Receptors; Transfection; Western,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mammals have evolved countermeasures to block siderophore-mediated iron acquisition as part of their innate immune response. Secreted lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) sequesters the Escherichia coli siderophore enterobactin (Ent), preventing E. coli from acquiring iron and protecting mammals from infection by E. coli. Here, we show that the iroA gene cluster, found in many pathogenic strains of Gram-negative enteric bacteria, including E. coli, Salmonella spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae, allows bacteria to evade sequestration of Ent by Lcn2. We demonstrate that C-glucosylated derivatives of Ent produced by iroA-encoded enzymes do not bind purified Lcn2, and an iroA-harboring strain of E. coli is insensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of Lcn2 in vitro. Furthermore, we show that mice rapidly succumb to infection by an iroA-harboring strain of E. coli but not its wild-type counterpart, and that this increased virulence depends on evasion of host Lcn2. Our findings indicate that the iroA gene cluster allows bacteria to evade this component of the innate immune system, rejuvenating their Ent-mediated iron-acquisition pathway and playing an important role in their virulence.",10/31/06,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,16502-7,,44,103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Membrane Fusion; Acute-Phase Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism; Animals; Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism; Enterobactin/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism; Escherichia coli/*genetics/*pathogenicity; Escherichia coli Infections/genetics/metabolism/microbiology/pathology; Knockout; Lipocalins; Mice; Multigene Family/*genetics; Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism; Survival Rate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scientific approaches of the past-including the intense focus on individual genes and proteins typical of molecular biology-have not been sufficient to address these challenges. The first decade of the twenty-first century has seen remarkable innovations in technology and computational methods. These new tools provide nearly comprehensive views of complex biological systems and can provide a correspondingly deeper understanding of pathogen-host interactions.

Analysis of common SNP-based haplotypes has revealed that most European HD subjects have distinguishable HTT haplotypes on their normal and disease chromosomes and that approximately 50% of the latter share the same major HD haplotype. We reasoned that sequence-level investigation of this founder haplotype could provide significant insights into the history of HD and valuable information for gene-targeting approaches. Consequently, we performed whole-genome sequencing of HD and control subjects from four independent families in whom the major European HD haplotype segregates with the disease. Analysis of the full-sequence-based HTT haplotype indicated that these four families share a common ancestor sufficiently distant to have permitted the accumulation of family-specific variants. Confirmation of new CAG-expansion mutations on this haplotype suggests that unlike most founders of human disease, the common ancestor of HD-affected families with the major haplotype most likely did not have HD. Further, availability of the full sequence data validated the use of SNP imputation to predict the optimal variants for capturing heterozygosity in personalized allele-specific gene-silencing approaches. As few as ten SNPs are capable of revealing heterozygosity in more than 97% of European HD subjects. Extension of allele-specific silencing strategies to the few remaining homozygous individuals is likely to be achievable through additional known SNPs and discovery of private variants by complete sequencing of HTT. These data suggest that the current development of gene-based targeting for HD could be extended to personalized allele-specific approaches in essentially all HD individuals of European ancestry.",9/3/15,2/8/16 18:55,2/8/16 18:59,,435-44,,,97,,Am J Hum Genet,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,"<p>Lee, Jong-Min<br/>Kim, Kyung-Hee<br/>Shin, Aram<br/>Chao, Michael J<br/>Abu Elneel, Kawther<br/>Gillis, Tammy<br/>Mysore, Jayalakshmi Srinidhi<br/>Kaye, Julia A<br/>Zahed, Hengameh<br/>Kratter, Ian H<br/>Daub, Aaron C<br/>Finkbeiner, Steven<br/>Li, Hong<br/>Roach, Jared C<br/>Goodman, Nathan<br/>Hood, Leroy<br/>Myers, Richard H<br/>MacDonald, Marcy E<br/>Gusella, James F<br/>GM076547/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/<br/>P50 NS016367/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/<br/>P50NS016367/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/<br/>R01 NS039074/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/<br/>R01 NS091161/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/<br/>R01NS091161/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/<br/>U01 NS082079/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/<br/>U01NS082079/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/<br/>X01 HG007750/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/<br/>Am J Hum Genet. 2015 Sep 3;97(3):435-44. doi: 10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.07.017.

The lack of induction of classical inflammatory mediators, including IL1-beta and TNF-alpha, during early infection has led to the suggestion that F. tularensis evades detection by host innate immune surveillance and/or actively suppresses inflammation. To gain more insight into the host response to Francisella infection during the acute stage, transcriptomic analysis was performed on lung tissue from mice exposed to virulent (Francisella tularensis ssp tularensis SchuS4). Despite an extensive transcriptional response in the lungs of animals as early as 4 hrs post-exposure, Francisella tularensis was associated with an almost complete lack of induction of immune-related genes during the initial 24 hrs post-exposure. This broad subversion of innate immune responses was particularly evident when compared to the pulmonary inflammatory response induced by other lethal (Yersinia pestis) and non-lethal (Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) pulmonary infections. However, the unique induction of a subset of inflammation-related genes suggests a role for dysregulation of lymphocyte function and anti-inflammatory pathways in the extreme virulence of Francisella. Subsequent activation of a classical inflammatory response 48 hrs post-exposure was associated with altered abundance of Francisella-specific transcripts, including those associated with bacterial surface components. In summary, virulent Francisella induces a unique pulmonary inflammatory response characterized by temporal regulation of innate immune pathways correlating with altered bacterial gene expression patterns. This study represents the first simultaneous measurement of both host and Francisella transcriptome changes that occur during in vivo infection and identifies potential bacterial virulence factors responsible for regulation of host inflammatory pathways.",2013,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e62412,,5,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether candidate gene polymorphisms were associated with altered urine inflammatory profiles in asymptomatic women with or without bacteriuria. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in 1,261 asymptomatic women ages 18-49 years originally enrolled as participants in a population-based case-control study of recurrent UTI and pyelonephritis. We genotyped polymorphisms in CXCR1, CXCR2, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TIRAP in women with and without ASB. We collected urine samples and measured levels of uropathogenic bacteria, neutrophils, and chemokines. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Polymorphism TLR2_G2258A, a variant associated with decreased lipopeptide-induced signaling, was associated with increased ASB risk (odds ratio 3.44, 95%CI; 1.65-7.17). Three CXCR1 polymorphisms were associated with ASB caused by gram-positive organisms. ASB was associated with urinary CXCL-8 levels, but not CXCL-5, CXCL-6, or sICAM-1 (P< or =0.0001). Urinary levels of CXCL-8 and CXCL-6, but not ICAM-1, were associated with higher neutrophil levels (P< or =0.0001). In addition, polymorphism CXCR1_G827C was associated with increased CXCL-8 levels in women with ASB (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: TLR2 and CXCR1 polymorphisms were associated with ASB and a CXCR1 variant was associated with urine CXCL-8 levels.

This approach consists of three steps. First, the proteome is extensively mapped out by multidimensional fractionation and tandem mass spectrometry, and the data generated are assembled in the PeptideAtlas database. Second, based on this proteome map, peptides uniquely identifying the proteins of interest, proteotypic peptides, are selected, and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions are established and validated by MS2 spectrum acquisition. This process of peptide selection, transition selection, and validation is supported by a suite of software tools, TIQAM (Targeted Identification for Quantitative Analysis by MRM), described in this study. Third, the selected target protein set is quantified in multiple samples by MRM.

These receptors, that include most notably members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family, recognize specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLR4 is a central part of the receptor complex that is involved in the activation of the immune system by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through the specific recognition of its endotoxic moiety (Lipid A). This is a critical event that is essential for the immune response to Gram-negative bacteria as well as the etiology of endotoxic shock. Interestingly, compared to mammals, fish are resistant to endotoxic shock. This in vivo resistance concurs with in vitro studies demonstrating significantly lowered sensitivity of fish leukocytes to LPS activation. Further, our in vitro analyses demonstrate that in trout mononuclear phagocytes, LPS fails to induce antiviral genes, an event that occurs downstream of TLR4 and is required for the development of endotoxic shock. Finally, an in silico approach that includes mining of different piscine genomic and EST databases, reveals the presence in fish of all of the major TLR signaling elements except for the molecules specifically involved in TLR4-mediated endotoxin recognition and signaling in mammals. Collectively, our analysis questions the existence of TLR4-mediated cellular responses to LPS in fish. We further speculate that other receptors, in particular beta-2 integrins, may play a primary role in the activation of piscine leukocytes by LPS.",12/5/05,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,6519-28,,29,579,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Endotoxins/*immunology/pharmacology; Evolution; Fishes/*immunology; Pattern Recognition/*immunology; Phagocytes/drug effects; Receptors; Toll-Like Receptors/genetics/immunology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They detect infectious organisms via a plethora of receptors, phagocytose them, and orchestrate an appropriate host response. Phagocytosis is extraordinarily complex: numerous receptors stimulate particle internalization, the cytoskeletal elements mediating internalization differ by receptor system and the nature of the pathogen being internalized, and the outcome can differ by bacterium. After generating a panel of 150 monoclonal antibodies that recognizes proteins recruited to the phagosome, analysis of novel phagocytic proteins was prioritized by focusing on those that behave differently during the internalization of virulent and avirulent bacteria. Several novel proteins that have roles in membrane extension were characterized. Although the inflammatory pathways leading to appropriate host response are reasonably well defined, it is not clear how macrophages define the threat precisely. Recent work indicates that Toll-like receptors play a key role in reading a ""bar code"" on invading microorganisms and in eliciting a specific immune response.

Recent studies suggest an association of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) polymorphisms with increased susceptibility to some infections. Here, we examined whether polymorphisms in TLR4 influence susceptibility to Legionnairesâ€°Ã›Âª disease (LD) by using a case-control study to compare the allele frequencies of two SNPs (A896G and C1196T). Cases (n = 108) were obtained from a LD outbreak in The Netherlands in 1999. Controls were exposed at the same outbreak, did not develop pneumonia, and were either unmatched (n = 421) or matched (n = 89) to patients for age, sex, and geographic residence. Allele 896G was associated with LD susceptibility with a frequency of 6.5% in the combined control group (matched and unmatched) vs. 2.5% in patients [odds ratio (OR) of 0.36, 95% confidence interval (C.I.) 0.14-0.91, P = 0.025]. In the matched control group comparison, allele 896G also showed a protective association with an OR of 0.27 (95% C.I. 0.09-0.75, P = 0.008).

Allele 1196T cosegregated with allele 896G and, thus, had identical associations.

ICAT-LC/MS showed a clear bias for high M(r) proteins and was complemented by the 2-DE/MS method, which showed a preference for low M(r) proteins and also identified cysteine-free proteins that were transparent to the ICAT-LC/MS method. Relative quantification between two strains of the M. tuberculosis complex also revealed that the two technologies provide complementary quantitative information; whereas the ICAT-LC/MS method quantifies the sum of the protein species of one gene product, the 2-DE/MS method quantifies at the level of resolved protein species, including post-translationally modified and processed polypeptides.

Several potential biomarkers of CKD have been reported, but none have been approved for preclinical or clinical use. Using RNA sequencing in a mouse model of folic acid-induced nephropathy, we identified ten genes that track kidney fibrosis development, the common pathologic finding in patients with CKD. The gene expression of all ten candidates was confirmed to be significantly higher (approximately ten- to 150-fold) in three well established, mechanistically distinct mouse models of kidney fibrosis than in models of nonfibrotic AKI. Protein expression of these genes was also high in the folic acid model and in patients with biopsy-proven kidney fibrosis. mRNA expression of the ten genes increased with increasing severity of kidney fibrosis, decreased in response to therapeutic intervention, and increased only modestly (approximately two- to five-fold) with liver fibrosis in mice and humans, demonstrating specificity for kidney fibrosis. Using targeted selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, we detected three of the ten candidates in human urine: cadherin 11 (CDH11), macrophage mannose receptor C1 (MRC1), and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP).

However, drug ADME and efficacy are also heavily influenced by epigenetic factors such as DNA/histone methylation and non-coding RNAs [especially microRNAs (miRNAs)]. Results from studies using tools, such as in silico miRNA target prediction, in vitro functional assays, nucleic acid profiling/sequencing and high-throughput proteomics, are rapidly expanding our knowledge of these factors and their effects on drug metabolism. Although these studies reveal a complex regulation of drug ADME, an increased understanding of the molecular interplay between the genome, epigenome and transcriptome has the potential to provide practically useful strategies to facilitate drug development, optimize therapeutic efficacy, circumvent adverse effects, yield novel diagnostics and ultimately become an integral component of personalized medicine. <b>LINKED ARTICLES: </b>This article is part of a themed section on Epigenetics and Therapy.

DESIGN: Single-cohort, prospective study with four visits at two weekly intervals. INTERVENTIONS: FENO and spirometry were assessed at all visits, and IS for differential cell count, leukotriene-B(4) (LTB(4)) and interleukin (IL)-8, nitrite, and nitrate at visit 1, visit 3, and visit 4. RESULTS: During the study, there were significant declines in mean percent predicted FEV(1), from 55.2 to 51.6% (p = 0.029), and mean FEV(1)/FVC ratio, from 50.4 to 45.4% (p = 0.001), accompanied by a significant increase in FENO geometric mean (95% confidence limits), from 15.2 (10.9 to 21.2) to 23.6 (17.1 to 32.4) parts per billion (p = 0.037), and sputum LTB(4), from 1.79 (1.03 to 3.11) to 3.57 (1.95 to 6.53) ng/mL (p = 0.033), but no significant change in other sputum parameters.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To test the hypothesis that polymorphisms in Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway genes are associated with susceptibility to UTIs, we conducted a population-based case-control study of women ages 18-49 years. We examined DNA variants in 9 TLR pathway genes in 431 recurrent cystitis (rUTI) cases, 400 pyelonephritis cases, and 430 controls with no history of UTIs. In the Caucasian subgroup of 987 women, polymorphism TLR4_A896G was associated with protection from rUTI, but not pyelonephritis, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.54 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.31 to 0.96. Polymorphism TLR5_C1174T, which encodes a variant that abrogates flagellin-induced signaling, was associated with an increased risk of rUTI (OR(95%CI): 1.81 (1.00-3.08)), but not pyelonephritis. Polymorphism TLR1_G1805T was associated with protection from pyelonephritis (OR(95%CI): 0.53 (0.29-0.96)). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence of associations of TLR5 and TLR1 variants with altered risks of acquiring rUTI and pyelonephritis, respectively.

With full informed consent from the Corpas family, all genotype, exome and metagenome data from members of this family, are publicly available under a public domain Creative Commons 0 (CC0) license waiver. All scientists or companies analysing these data (""the Corpasome"") were invited to return results to the family. METHODS: We released 5 genotypes, 4 exomes, 1 metagenome from the Corpas family via a blog and figshare under a public domain license, inviting scientists to join the crowdsourcing efforts to analyse the genomes in return for coauthorship or acknowldgement in derived papers. Resulting analysis data were compiled via social media and direct email. RESULTS: Here we present the results of our investigations, combining the crowdsourced contributions and our own efforts. Four companies offering annotations for genomic variants were applied to four family exomes: BIOBASE, Ingenuity, Diploid, and GeneTalk. Starting from a common VCF file and after selecting for significant results from company reports, we find no overlap among described annotations. We additionally report on a gut microbiome analysis of a member of the Corpas family. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents an analysis of a diverse set of tools and methods offered by four DTC companies. The striking discordance of the results mirrors previous findings with respect to DTC analysis of SNP chip data, and highlights the difficulties of using DTC data for preventive medical care.

ATF3-deficient mice developed significantly increased airway hyperresponsiveness, pulmonary eosinophilia, and enhanced chemokine and Th2 cytokine responses in lung tissue and in lung-derived CD4(+) lymphocytes. Although several TFs have been associated with enhanced inflammatory responses in the lung, ATF3 attenuates the inflammatory responses associated with allergic airway disease.",9/29/08,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,2349-57,,10,205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Activating Transcription Factor 3/genetics/*immunology; Allergens/immunology; Animals; Asthma/*immunology; Bronchial Hyperreactivity/*immunology; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology; Chemokines/genetics/immunology; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic; Humans; Interleukin-4/genetics/immunology; Interleukin-5/genetics/immunology; Interleukin-13/genetics/immunology; Knockout; Lung/cytology/immunology/pathology; Mice; Ovalbumin/immunology; Pneumonia/*immunology/pathology; Promoter Regions; Pulmonary Eosinophilia/immunology; Th2 Cells/immunology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study subjects included eight health care workers involved in the administration of tgAAVCF in a phase II study and 12 control health care workers who were involved with the treatment of CF patients, but not administration of the study drug. The exposure assessment entailed the determination of personal and area airborne tgAAVCF concentrations. In addition, serologic status of the health care workers was evaluated throughout the study for the presence of antibodies to AAV. A symptom survey was also completed by both the active and control health care workers. Air samples were analyzed by an infectivity assay (active vector) and a DNA polymerase chain reaction amplification procedure (vector DNA). Air monitoring was conducted during 13 tgAAVCF and seven placebo administrations. Active vector and vector particles were detected in four of 51 and 48 of 51 air samples collected during the administration of tgAAVCF, respectively. Based on the airborne vector particle concentration, the workersâ€°Ã›Âª exposure was estimated to be 0.0006% of the administered dose.

The Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) has seamlessly integrated these disparate fields to create a cross-disciplinary platform and culture in which ""biology drives technology drives computation."" To achieve this platform/culture, it has been necessary for cross-disciplinary ISB scientists to learn one anotherâ€°Ã›Âªs languages and work together effectively in teams. The focus of this ""systems"" approach on disease has led to a discipline denoted systems medicine. The advent of technological breakthroughs in the fields of genomics, proteomics, and, indeed, the other ""omics"" is catalyzing striking advances in systems medicine that have and are transforming diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Systems medicine has united genomics and genetics through family genomics to more readily identify disease genes. It has made blood a window into health and disease. It is leading to the stratification of diseases (division into discrete subtypes) for proper impedance match against drugs and the stratification of patients into subgroups that respond to environmental challenges in a similar manner (e.g. response to drugs, response to toxins, etc.). The convergence of patient-activated social networks, big data and their analytics, and systems medicine has led to a P4 medicine that is predictive, preventive, personalized, and participatory. Medicine will focus on each individual. It will become proactive in nature. It will increasingly focus on wellness rather than disease. For example, in 10 years each patient will be surrounded by a virtual cloud of billions of data points, and we will have the tools to reduce this enormous data dimensionality into simple hypotheses about how to optimize wellness and avoid disease for each individual. P4 medicine will be able to detect and treat perturbations in healthy individuals long before disease symptoms appear, thus optimizing the wellness of individuals and avoiding disease. P4 medicine will 1) improve health care, 2) reduce the cost of health care, and 3) stimulate innovation and new company creation. Health care is not the only subject that can benefit from such integrative, cross-disciplinary, and systems-driven platforms and cultures. Many other challenges plaguing our planet, such as energy, environment, nutrition, and agriculture can be transformed by using such an integrated and systems-driven approach.",2013-04,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e0012,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current technologies generate diploid sequence data that is rarely resolved into its constituent haplotypes. Furthermore, paradigms for thinking about genomic information are based on interpreting genotypes rather than haplotypes. Nevertheless, haplotypes have historically been useful in contexts ranging from population genetics to disease-gene mapping efforts. The main approaches for phasing genomic sequence data are molecular haplotyping, genetic haplotyping, and population-based inference. Long-read sequencing technologies are enabling longer molecular haplotypes, and decreases in the cost of whole-genome sequencing are enabling the sequencing of whole-chromosome genetic haplotypes. Hybrid approaches combining high-throughput short-read assembly with strategic approaches that enable physical or virtual binning of reads into haplotypes are enabling multi-gene haplotypes to be generated from single individuals. These techniques can be further combined with genetic and population approaches. Here, we review advances in whole-genome haplotyping approaches and discuss the importance of haplotypes for genomic medicine. Clinical applications include diagnosis by recognition of compound heterozygosity and by phasing regulatory variation to coding variation. Haplotypes, which are more specific than less complex variants such as single nucleotide variants, also have applications in prognostics and diagnostics, in the analysis of tumors, and in typing tissue for transplantation. Future advances will include technological innovations, the application of standard metrics for evaluating haplotype quality, and the development of databases that link haplotypes to disease.",2014,2/5/16 22:14,2/9/16 0:19,,73,,9,6,,Genome Med,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 25473435 PMCID: PMC4254418,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Probabilistic modeling methods such as Bayesian Networks (BN) fall into this class, as do Hierarchical Bayesian Networks (HBN), Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBN), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Markov Logic Networks (MLN). In this review, we describe the most general of these (MLN), and show how the above-mentioned methods are related to MLN and one another by the imposition of constraints and restrictions. This approach allows us to illustrate a broad landscape of constructions and methods, and describe some of the attendant strengths, weaknesses, and constraints of many of these methods. We then provide some examples of their applications to problems in biology and medicine, with an emphasis on genetics. The key concepts needed to picture this landscape of methods are the ideas of probabilistic graphical models, the structures of the graphs, and the scope of the logical language repertoire used (from First-Order Logic [FOL] to Boolean logic.) These concepts are interlinked and together define the nature of each of the probabilistic logic methods. Finally, we discuss the initial applications of MLN to genetics, show the relationship to less general methods like BN, and then mention several examples where such methods could be effective in new applications to specific biological and medical problems.",2012-03,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,316-36,,3,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One type of noncoding RNAs are termed microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are evolutionary conserved, approximately 22-nucleotide single-stranded RNAs that target genes by inducing mRNA degradation or by inhibiting translation. miRNAs are implicated in many critical cellular processes, including apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. Furthermore, it is estimated that miRNAs may be responsible for regulating the expression of nearly one-third of the human genome. Despite the identification of greater than 500 mature miRNAs, very little is known about their biological functions and functional targets. In the last 5 years, researchers have increasingly focused on the functional relevance and role that miRNAs play in the pathogenesis of human disease. miRNAs are known to be important in solid organ and hematological malignancies, heart disease, as potential modulators of the immune response, and organ development. It is anticipated that miRNA analysis will emerge as an important complement to proteomic and genomic studies to further our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Despite the application of genomics and proteomics to the study of human lung disease, few studies have examined miRNA expression.

The environment and gene-regulatory influence network (EGRIN) model of the strain was constructed from a compendium of transcriptome data that was collected over 58 different steady-state and time-course experiments that were performed in chemostats or batch cultures under a spectrum of environmental perturbations that modulated methanogenesis. Analyses of the EGRIN model have revealed novel components of methanogenesis that included at least three additional protein-coding genes of previously unknown function as well as one noncoding RNA. We discovered that at least five regulatory mechanisms act in a combinatorial scheme to intercoordinate key steps of methanogenesis with different processes such as motility, ATP biosynthesis, and carbon assimilation. Through a combination of genetic and environmental perturbation experiments we have validated the EGRIN-predicted role of two novel transcription factors in the regulation of phosphate-dependent repression of formate dehydrogenase-a key enzyme in the methanogenesis pathway.

Over 163 sequence variants have been associated with IBD in genome-wide association studies, but they have weak effects and explain only a fraction of the observed heritability. It is expected that additional variants contribute to the genomic architecture of IBD, possibly including rare variants with effect sizes larger than the identified common variants. Here we applied a family study design and sequenced 38 individuals from five families, under the hypothesis that families with multiple IBD-affected individuals harbor one or more risk variants that (i) are shared among affected family members, (ii) are rare and (iii) have substantial effect on disease development. Our analysis revealed not only novel candidate risk variants but also high polygenic risk scores for common known risk variants in four out of the five families. Functional analysis of our top novel variant in the remaining family, a rare missense mutation in the ubiquitin ligase TRIM11, suggests that it leads to increased nuclear factor of kappa light chain enhancer in B-cells (NF-Ã«Â¼B) signaling.

To further investigate the role of the TL1A-DR3 pathway in Th17 regulation, we generated a TL1A-deficient mouse and found that TL1A(-/-) dendritic cells exhibited a reduced capacity in supporting Th17 differentiation and proliferation. Consistent with these data, TL1A(-/-) animals displayed decreased clinical severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).

The 'Top-Scoring Pair' (TSP) classification method identifies pairs of genes whose relative expression correlates strongly with phenotype. In this study, we sought to assess the effectiveness of the TSP approach in the identification of diagnostic classifiers for a number of human diseases including bacterial and viral infection, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, Crohn's disease, and transformed ulcerative colitis. We examined transcriptional profiles from both solid tissues and blood-borne leukocytes. RESULTS: The algorithm identified multiple predictive gene pairs for each phenotype, with cross-validation accuracy ranging from 70 to nearly 100 percent, and high sensitivity and specificity observed in most classification tasks. Performance compared favourably with that of pre-existing transcription-based classifiers, and in some cases was comparable to the accuracy of current clinical diagnostic procedures. Several diseases of solid tissues could be reliably diagnosed through classifiers based on the blood-borne leukocyte transcriptome. The TSP classifier thus represents a simple yet robust method to differentiate between diverse phenotypic states based on gene expression profiles. CONCLUSION: Two-transcript classifiers have the potential to reliably classify diverse human diseases, through analysis of both local diseased tissue and the immunological response assayed through blood-borne leukocytes. The experimental simplicity of this method results in measurements that can be easily translated to clinical practice.",2009,2/8/16 23:58,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,10,,BMC Genomics,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,"*Diagnosis; *Transcription, Genetic; Algorithms; Disease/*genetics; Humans; Prognosis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adenosine is elevated in the lungs of animal models and humans with chronic lung disease where it promotes air-space destruction and fibrosis. Adenosine signaling increases the production of the pro-fibrotic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that IL-6 signaling contributes to tissue destruction and remodeling in a model of chronic lung disease where adenosine levels are elevated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We tested this hypothesis by neutralizing or genetically removing IL-6 in adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient mice that develop adenosine dependent pulmonary inflammation and remodeling. Results demonstrated that both pharmacologic blockade and genetic removal of IL-6 attenuated pulmonary inflammation, remodeling and fibrosis in this model. The pursuit of mechanisms involved revealed adenosine and IL-6 dependent activation of STAT-3 in airway epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that adenosine enhances IL-6 signaling pathways to promote aspects of chronic lung disease. This suggests that blocking IL-6 signaling during chronic stages of disease may provide benefit in halting remodeling processes such as fibrosis and air-space destruction.",2011,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e22667,,7,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J.",Systems biology of interstitial lung diseases: integration of mRNA and microRNA expression changes,BMC Medical Genomics,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1755-8794-4-8,,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The molecular pathways involved in the interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are poorly understood. Systems biology approaches, with global expression data sets, were used to identify perturbed gene networks, to gain some understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and to develop specific hypotheses relevant to these chronic lung diseases. METHODS: Lung tissue samples from patients with different types of ILD were obtained from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium and total cell RNA was isolated. Global mRNA and microRNA were both profiled and differential expression changes verified by hybridization and amplification-based methods. Differentially expressed genes were compiled and used to identify critical signaling pathways and potential biomarkers. Modules of genes were identified that formed a regulatory network and studies were performed on cultured cells in vitro for comparison with the in vivo results. RESULTS: By profiling mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression levels, we found subsets of differentially expressed genes that distinguished patients with ILDs from controls and that correlated with different disease stages and subtypes of ILDs. Network analysis, based on pathway databases, revealed several disease-associated gene modules, involving genes from the TGF-beta, Wnt, focal adhesion, and smooth muscle actin pathways that are implicated in advancing fibrosis, a critical pathological process in ILDs. A more comprehensive approach was also adapted to construct a putative global gene regulatory network based on the perturbation of key regulatory elements, transcription factors and microRNAs. Our data underscores the importance of TGF-beta signaling and the persistence of smooth muscle actin-containing fibroblasts in these diseases. We present evidence that, downstream of TGF-beta signaling, microRNAs of the miR-23a cluster and the transcription factor Zeb1 could have roles in mediating an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the resultant persistence of mesenchymal cells in these diseases. CONCLUSIONS: We present a comprehensive overview of the molecular networks perturbed in ILDs, discuss several potential key molecular regulatory circuits, and identify microRNA species that may play central roles in facilitating the progression of ILDs. These findings advance our understanding of these diseases at the molecular level, provide new molecular signatures in defining the specific characteristics of the diseases, suggest new hypotheses, and reveal new potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",1/17/11,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,8,,1,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our analysis identified a haplotype of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 17 within a chemokine gene cluster associated with delayed onset of mild-cognitive impairment and dementia. Individuals carrying this haplotype had a mean AAO of mild-cognitive impairment at 51.0 +/- 5.2 years compared with 41.1 +/- 7.4 years for those without these SNPs. This haplotype thus appears to modify Alzheimer's AAO, conferring a large (~10 years) protective effect. The associated locus harbors several chemokines including eotaxin-1 encoded by CCL11, and the haplotype includes a missense polymorphism in this gene. Validating this association, we found plasma eotaxin-1 levels were correlated with disease AAO in an independent cohort from the University of California San Francisco Memory and Aging Center. In this second cohort, the associated haplotype disrupted the typical age-associated increase of eotaxin-1 levels, suggesting a complex regulatory role for this haplotype in the general population.

To identify mechanisms leading to immunosenescence, primary CD4 T cell responses were examined in 60- to 75-year-old individuals lacking overt functional defects. Transcriptome analysis indicated a selective defect in zinc homeostasis. CD4 T cell activation was associated with zinc influx via the zinc transporter Zip6, leading to increased free cytoplasmic zinc and activation of negative feedback loops, including the induction of zinc-binding metallothioneins. In young adults, activation-induced cytoplasmic zinc concentrations declined after 2 days to below prestimulation levels. In contrast, activated naive CD4 T cells from older individuals failed to downregulate cytoplasmic zinc, resulting in excessive induction of metallothioneins. Activation-induced metallothioneins regulated the redox state in activated T cells and accounted for an increased proliferation of old CD4 T cells, suggesting that regulation of T cell zinc homeostasis functions as a compensatory mechanism to preserve the replicative potential of naive CD4 T cells with age.",2008-12,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 20:16,,1001-11,,6,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Signal Transduction; Adult; Aged; Aging/*immunology; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology; Cell Proliferation; Cytoplasm/metabolism; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Metallothionein/*genetics/metabolism; Middle Aged; Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism; Zinc/*metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also show that the Hsp40 chaperone Ydj1, which contains an low-complexity domain and controls prion protein aggregation, is required for the formation of Dhh1-GFP foci on glucose depletion. New classes of proteins that reproducibly coenrich with Dhh1-GFP during PB induction include proteins involved in nucleotide or amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, transfer RNA aminoacylation, and protein folding. Many of these proteins have been shown to form foci in response to other stresses.

However, TGN protein transport to the PVC is accelerated in mutants lacking function of Inp53p. Inp53p contains a SacI polyphosphoinositide phosphatase domain, a 5-phosphatase domain, and a proline-rich domain. Here we show that all three domains are required to mediate ""slow delivery"" of TGN proteins into the PVC. Although deletion of the proline-rich domain did not affect general membrane association, it caused localization to become less specific. The proline-rich domain was shown to bind to two proteins, including clathrin heavy chain, Chc1p. Unlike chc1 mutants, inp53 mutants do not mislocalize TGN proteins to the cell surface, consistent with the idea that Chc1p and Inp53p act at a common vesicular trafficking step but that Chc1p is used at other steps also. Like mutations in the AP-1 adaptor complex, mutations in INP53 exhibit synthetic growth and transport defects when combined with mutations in the GGA proteins.

FAIMS fractionates ions in the gas-phase according to characteristic differences in mobilities in electric fields of different strengths. Undesired ion species such as solvated clusters and singly-charged chemical background ions can be prevented from reaching the mass analyzer, thus decreasing chemical noise. To date, there has been limited success using the commercially available Thermo Fisher FAIMS device with both standard ESI and nanoLC-MS. We have modified a Thermo Fisher electrospray source to accommodate a fused silica pulled tip capillary column for nanospray ionization which will enable standard laboratories access to FAIMS technology. Our modified source allows easily obtainable stable spray at flow rates of 300 nL/min when coupled with FAIMS. The modified electrospray source allows the use of sheath gas, which provides a 5-fold increase in signal obtained when nanoLC is coupled to FAIMS. In this work, nanoLC-FAIMS-MS and nanoLC-MS were compared by analyzing a tryptic digest of a 1:1 mixture of SILAC-labeled haploid and diploid yeast to demonstrate the performance of nanoLC-FAIMS-MS, at different compensation voltages, for post-column fractionation of complex protein digests. The effective dynamic range more than doubled when FAIMS was used.

T.; Aebersold, R.",Peptide electroextraction for direct coupling of in-gel digests with capillary LC-MS/MS for protein identification and sequencing,Analytical Chemistry,,,,,"An electrophoretic method has been developed for the extraction of peptides following in-gel digests of SDS-PAGE separated proteins. During electroextraction, the peptides are trapped on a strong cation-exchange microcartridge, before analysis by capillary LCâ€°Ã›Ã’ESI-tandem mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained by tandem mass spectrometry are searched directly against a protein database for identification of the protein from which the peptide originated. By minimizing surface exposure of the peptides during electroextraction, a reduction of the detection limits for protein identification is realized. The performance of the peptide electroextraction was compared directly with the standard extraction method for in-gel protein digests, using a standard dilution series of phosphorylase B and carbonic anhydrase, separated by SDS-PAGE. The lowest gel loading in which phosphorylase B was identified using the standard extraction method was 2.5 ng or 25 fmol, and the lowest gel loading in which phosphorylase B was identified using electroextraction was 1.25 ng or 12.5 fmol. The design of the microextraction cartridge allows for direct interfacing with capillary LC, which is crucial for maintaining low detection limits. Furthermore, this method can be used for high-throughput proteomics since it can be easily multiplexed and requires only voltage control and low pressures (approximately 15 psi) for operation. We believe that peptide electroextraction is a significant advance for identification of proteins separated by one-dimensional or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, as it can be easily automated and requires less protein than conventional methods.",9/1/00,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,4115-21,,17,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Sequence Analysis; Amino Acid Sequence; Chromatography; Liquid; Mass Spectrometry; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptides/*isolation & purification; Protein; Proteins/*analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method is based on the observation that proteins labeled with isotopically different isotope-coded affinity tag reagents precisely co-migrate during two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and that therefore two or more isotopically encoded samples can be separated concurrently in the same gel. By analyzing changes in the proteome of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) induced by a metabolic shift we show that this simple method accurately quantifies changes in protein abundance even in cases in which multiple proteins migrate to the same gel coordinates.

To address this issue, we sequenced a complete rhesus macaque MHC spanning over 5.3 Mb, and obtained an additional 2.3 Mb from a second haplotype, including class II and portions of class I and class III.

Interpreting relationships of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sequences can be challenging because of their rapidly evolving genomes, but it may also lead to a better understanding of the underlying biology. Several studies have focused on the evolution of HIV-1, but there is little information to link sequence similarities and evolutionary histories of HIV-1 to the epidemiological information of the infected individual. Our goal was to correlate patterns of HIV-1 genetic diversity with epidemiological information, including risk and demographic factors. These correlations were then used to predict epidemiological information through analyzing short stretches of HIV-1 sequence. Using standard phylogenetic and phenetic techniques on 100 HIV-1 subtype B sequences, we were able to show some correlation between the viral sequences and the geographic area of infection and the risk of men who engage in sex with men. To help identify more subtle relationships between the viral sequences, the method of multidimensional scaling (MDS) was performed. That method identified statistically significant correlations between the viral sequences and the risk factors of men who engage in sex with men and individuals who engage in sex with injection drug users or use injection drugs themselves. Using tree construction, MDS, and newly developed likelihood assignment methods on the original 100 samples we sequenced, and also on a set of blinded samples, we were able to predict demographic/risk group membership at a rate statistically better than by chance alone. Such methods may make it possible to identify viral variants belonging to specific demographic groups by examining only a small portion of the HIV-1 genome. Such predictions of demographic epidemiology based on sequence information may become valuable in assigning different treatment regimens to infected individuals.",2003-07,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,1168-80,,7,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adolescent; Adult; Demography; DNA; Evolution; Female; Genetic; Genetic Variation; Genome; Great Britain/epidemiology; HIV-1/classification/ genetics; HIV Envelope Protein gp120/ genetics; HIV Infections/ epidemiology/genetics/virology; Homosexuality; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models; Molecular; Phylogeny; Risk Factors; Sequence Analysis; Viral; Viral/genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enzyme was solubilized from bovine spleen, and an approximately 43,000-fold purified preparation containing a major 89-kDa candidate component was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic peptides. SART2 (squamous cell carcinoma antigen recognized by T cell 2), a protein with unknown function highly expressed in cancers cells and tissues, was identified by 18 peptides covering 26% of the sequence. Transient expression of cDNA resulted in a 22-fold increase in epimerase activity in 293HEK cell lysate. Moreover, overexpressing cells produced dermatan sulfate chains with 20% of iduronic acid-containing disaccharide units, as compared with 5% for mock-transfected cells. The iduronic acid residues were preferentially clustered in blocks, as in naturally occurring dermatan sulfate. Given the discovered identity, we propose to rename SART2 (Nakao, M., Shichijo, S., Imaizumi, T., Inoue, Y., Matsunaga, K., Yamada, A., Kikuchi, M., Tsuda, N., Ohta, K., Takamori, S., Yamana, H., Fujita, H., and Itoh, K.

It is highly homologous to part of the NCAG1 protein, encoded by the C18orf4 gene, genetically linked to bipolar disorder.

To investigate the role of Chz1p in chromatin organization, we performed genome-wide expression arrays and chromatin immunoprecipitations of SIR complex components and modified histones in a CHZ1 deletion strain. Deletion of CHZ1 led to reduced ubiquitination of subtelomere-associated H2B, reduced subtelomeric H3K79 di-methylation, and increased binding of Sir3p, and Sir4p at telomere-distal euchromatin regions, correlating with decreased gene expression in subtelomeric regions. This anti-silencing defect appears to be mediated by enhanced association of de-ubiquitinase Ubp10p with subtelomeric DNA, as detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. In support of this, we show that deletion of UBP10 can antagonize the subtelomeric silencing phenotype of Deltachz1.

However, the genome reorganization events that drive this process are also the roots of instability for existing operons. We have determined that there exists a statistically significant trend that correlates the proportion of genes encoded in operons in archaea to their phylogenetic lineage. We have further characterized how microbes deal with operon instability by mapping and comparing transcriptome architectures of four phylogenetically diverse extremophiles that span the range of operon stabilities observed across archaeal lineages: a photoheterotrophic halophile (Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1), a hydrogenotrophic methanogen (Methanococcus maripaludis S2), an acidophilic and aerobic thermophile (Sulfolobus solfataricus P2), and an anaerobic hyperthermophile (Pyrococcus furiosus DSM 3638). We demonstrate how the evolution of transcriptional elements (promoters and terminators) generates new operons, restores the coordinated regulation of translocated, inverted, and newly acquired genes, and introduces completely novel regulation for even some of the most conserved operonic genes such as those encoding subunits of the ribosome. The inverse correlation (r = -0.92) between the proportion of operons with such internally located transcriptional elements and the fraction of conserved operons in each of the four archaea reveals an unprecedented view into varying stages of operon evolution.

RESULTS: Analysis of the genome draft of the fugu pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) reveals the existence of a fourth runt domain gene, FrRUNT, in addition to the orthologs of human RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3. The tiny FrRUNT packs six exons and two putative promoters in just 3 kb of genomic sequence. The first exon is located within an intron of FrSUPT3H, the ortholog of human SUPT3H, and the first exon of FrSUPT3H resides within the first intron of FrRUNT. The two gene structures are therefore ""interlocked"". In the human genome, SUPT3H is instead interlocked with RUNX2. FrRUNT has no detectable ortholog in the genomes of mammals, birds or amphibians. We consider alternative explanations for an apparent contradiction between the phylogenetic data and the comparison of the genomic neighborhoods of human and fugu runt domain genes. We hypothesize that an ancient RUNT locus was lost in the tetrapod lineage, together with FrFSTL6, a member of a novel family of follistatin-like genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the runt domain family may have started expanding in chordates much earlier than previously thought, and exemplify the importance of detailed analysis of whole-genome draft sequence to provide new insights into gene evolution.",11/4/04,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,43,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit; Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit; Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit; Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits; DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics; Evolution; Follistatin/genetics; Gene Deletion; Genome; Humans; Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Neoplasm Proteins/genetics; Nucleic Acid; Peptides/ genetics; Phylogeny; Protein Structure; Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics; Sequence Homology; Takifugu/ genetics; Tertiary/genetics; Tetraodontiformes/genetics; Transcription Factors/ genetics; Zebrafish/genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To that end, an open-source, functionally complete, high-throughput and readily extensible MS/MS spectral searching tool, SpectraST, was developed. A high-quality spectral library was constructed by combining the high-confidence identifications of millions of spectra taken from various data repositories and searched using four sequence search engines.

Myc binds to the mtCLIC gene promoter and activates its transcription. Suppression of mtCLIC expression by RNA interference inhibited Myc-induced apoptosis in response to different stress conditions and abolished the cooperative induction of apoptosis by Myc and Bax. We also found that Myc reduces the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and that the apoptosis-inducing stimuli up-regulate Bax expression.

In proteomics, MRM-MS can be used to monitor and quantify a peptide based on the production of expected fragment peaks from the selected peptide precursor ion. The choice of which fragment ions to monitor in order to achieve maximum sensitivity in MRM-MS can potentially be guided by existing MS/MS spectra. However, because the majority of discovery experiments are performed on ion trap platforms, there is concern in the field regarding the generalizability of these spectra to MRM-MS on a triple quadrupole instrument. In light of this concern, many operators perform an optimization step to determine the most intense fragments for a target peptide on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. We have addressed this issue by targeting, on a triple quadrupole, the top six y-ion peaks from ion trap-derived consensus library spectra for 258 doubly charged peptides from three different sample sets and quantifying the observed elution curves. This analysis revealed a strong correlation between the y-ion peak rank order and relative intensity across platforms. This suggests that y-type ions obtained from ion trap-based library spectra are well-suited for generating MRM-MS assays for triple quadrupoles and that optimization is not required for each target peptide.",2009-09,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,4243-51,,9,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Area Under Curve; Databases; Mass Spectrometry/*methods; Peptide Fragments/*chemistry/metabolism; Protein; Proteomics/*methods; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism; Trypsin/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peroxisomes are highly dynamic and change in size and number in response to both intra- and extracellular cues. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, peroxisome growth and division are controlled by both the differential import of soluble matrix proteins and a specialized divisional machinery that includes peroxisome-specific factors such as members of the Pex11 protein family and general organelle divisional factors like the dynamin-related protein Vps1p. Global yeast 2-hybrid analyses have demonstrated interactions between the product of the S. cerevisiae gene of unknown function, YCL056c, and Pex proteins involved in peroxisome biogenesis. Here we show that the protein encoded by YCL056c, renamed Pex34p, is a peroxisomal integral membrane protein that acts independently and also in concert with the Pex11 protein family members Pex11p, Pex25p and Pex27p to control the peroxisome populations of cells under conditions of both peroxisome proliferation and constitutive peroxisome division. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that Pex34p interacts physically with itself and with Pex11p, Pex25p and Pex27p but not with Vps1p. Pex34p can act as a positive effector of peroxisome division as its overexpression leads to increased numbers of peroxisomes in wild-type and pex34Delta cells. Pex34p requires the Pex11 family proteins to promote peroxisome division. Our discovery of Pex34p as a protein involved in the already complex control of peroxisome populations emphasizes the necessity of cells to strictly regulate their peroxisome populations to be able to respond appropriately to changing environmental conditions.",3/25/11,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the 150 proteins positively identified and quantified in the O(3)-treated plants, we identified thirteen proteins whose abundance was greater in the AtMPK6-suppressed genotype than in wild-type (WT). These include the antioxidant proteins, monodehydroascorbate reductase, peroxiredoxin Q, and glutathione reductase. A further eighteen proteins were identified whose abundance was lower in the ozone-treated AtMPK6-suppressed line relative to ozone-exposed WT plants. These predominantly comprised proteins involved in carbohydrate-, energy-, and amino acid metabolism, and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. In control plants, five proteins increased, and nine proteins decreased in abundance in the AtMPK6-suppressed genotype compared to that of the WT, reflecting changes in the protein composition of plants that have AtMPK6 constitutively suppressed. Since a number of these proteins are part of the redox response pathway, and loss of AtMPK6 renders Arabidopsis more susceptible to oxidative stress, we propose that AtMPK6 plays a key role in the plantâ€°Ã›Âªs overall ability to manage oxidative stress.",2009-06,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,497-505,,6,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arabidopsis/genetics/*metabolism; Arabidopsis Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Genotype; Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism; Isotope Labeling; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism; Oxidative Stress; Ozone/*metabolism; Plant; Proteomics/*methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In agreement with these findings, mutations in Spt8 and the TFIIA NTD interact genetically. Using purified proteins, it was found that TFIIA and Spt8 do not stably bind to each other, but rather both compete for binding to TBP. Consistent with this competition, Spt8 inhibits the binding of SAGA to PICs in the absence of activator. In the presence of activator, Spt8 enhances transcription in vitro, and the positive function of the TFIIA NTD is largely mediated through Spt8.

We identified Myo1p, Myo2p, Pan1p, and the protein encoded by YFR016c as proteins that interact with Spa2p. Strikingly, all of these proteins are involved in cell polarity and/or actin function. Here we focus on the functional significance of the interactions of Spa2p with Myo2p and Myo1p. We find that localization of Spa2GFP to sites of polarized growth depends on functional Myo2p but not on Myo1p. We also find that Spa2p, like Myo2p, cosediments with F-actin in an ATP-sensitive manner. We hypothesize that Spa2p associates with actin via a direct or indirect interaction with Myo2p and that Spa2p may be involved in mediating polarized localization of polarity proteins via Myo2p. In addition, we observe an enhanced cell-separation defect in a myo1spa2 strain at 37 degrees C. This provides further evidence that Spa2p is involved in cytokinesis and cell wall morphogenesis.",2005-10,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,4595-608,,10,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Actins/*metabolism; Cell Polarity; Cell Wall/metabolism; Cytokinesis; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Fungal Proteins/metabolism; Microfilament Proteins; Myosin Heavy Chains/metabolism; Myosin Type V/metabolism; Protein Binding; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/cytology/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/*metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used label-free quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics tools to decipher the regulation of phagosome maturation and antigen presentation pathways in Mphis and DCs.

A combination of cryolysis and urea solubilization was used to minimize the opportunity for reorientation of the phosphoproteome, and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and IMAC chemistries were used to fractionate and enrich for phosphopeptides. Using these approaches, numerous phosphorylated peptides specific to oleate-induced and glucose-repressed conditions were identified and mapped to known signaling pathways. These include several transcription factors, two of which, Pip2p and Cst6p, must be phosphorylated for the normal transcriptional response of fatty acid-responsive loci encoding peroxisomal proteins. The phosphoproteome data were integrated with results from genome-wide assays studying the effects of signaling molecule deletions and known protein-protein interactions to generate a putative fatty acid-responsive signaling network. In this network, the most highly connected nodes are those with the largest effects on cellular responses to oleic acid.

The MIAPE Quant guidelines describe the HUPO-PSI proposal concerning the minimum information to be reported when a quantitative data set, derived from mass spectrometry (MS), is submitted to a database or as supplementary information to a journal. The guidelines have been developed with input from a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the proteomics field to represent a true consensus view of the most important data types and metadata, required for a quantitative experiment to be analyzed critically or a data analysis pipeline to be reproduced.

In this approach, glycopeptides derived from glycoproteins are enriched by selective capture onto a solid support using hydrazide chemistry followed by enzymatic release of the peptides and subsequent analysis by tandem mass spectrometry. The approach was validated using standard protein mixtures that resulted in a close to 100% capture efficiency. Our capture approach was then applied to microsomal fractions of the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancers cell line IGROV-1/CP. With a Protein Prophet probability value greater than 0.9, we identified a total of 302 proteins with an average protein identification rate of 136 +/- 19 (n = 4) in a single linear quadrupole ion trap (LTQ) mass spectrometer nano-LC-MS experiment and a selectivity of 91 +/- 1.6% (n = 4) for the N-linked glycoconsensus sequence. Our method has several advantages. 1) Digestion of proteins initially into peptides improves the solubility of large membrane proteins and exposes all of the glycosylation sites to ensure equal accessibility to capture reagents. 2) Capturing glycosylated peptides can effectively reduce sample complexity and at the same time increase the confidence of MS-based protein identifications (more potential peptide identifications per protein). 3) The utility of sodium sulfite as a quencher in our capture approach to replace the solid phase extraction step in an earlier glycoprotein chemical capture approach for removing excess sodium periodate allows the overall capture procedure to be completed in a single vessel. This improvement minimizes sample loss, increases sensitivity, and makes our protocol amenable for high throughput implementation, a feature that is essential for biomarker identification and validation of a large number of clinical samples. 4) The approach is demonstrated here on the analysis of N-linked glycopeptides; however, it can be applied equally well to O-glycoprotein analysis.",2007-01,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,141-9,,1,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Avidin/chemistry; Cattle; Chickens; Cultured; Electrospray Ionization/ methods; Glycopeptides/ analysis/chemistry; Glycoproteins/chemistry; Glycosylation; Humans; Mass; Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization/ methods; Microsomes; Molecular Sequence Data; Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry; Proteomics/ methods; Spectrometry; Tumor Cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this challenge in Proteomics data analysis, we review common approaches developed to incorporate biological function and network topological information. We categorize existing tools into four categories: tools with basic functional information and little topological features (e.g., GO category analysis), tools with rich functional information and little topological features (e.g., GSEA), tools with basic functional information and rich topological features (e.g., Cytoscape), and tools with rich functional information and rich topological features (e.g., PathwayExpress).

The set of high-scoring peptide-spectrum matches for a defined set of input spectra differs markedly among the various search engine results; individual engines each provide unique correct identifications among a core set of correlative identifications.

In a first step, the discovery phase, the proteome observable by mass spectrometry is extensively analyzed. The resulting proteome catalog can then be used to select peptides specific to only one protein, so-called proteotypic peptides (PTPs). It represents the basis to realize sensitive, robust and reproducible measurements based on targeted mass spectrometry of these PTPs in a subsequent scoring phase. In this Extra View we describe the need for such proteome catalogs and their multiple benefits for catalyzing the shift towards targeted quantitative proteomic analysis and beyond.

In its mostly used form, a total protein digest is separated by ion exchange fractionation in the first dimension followed by off- or on-line RP LC-MS/MS. We replaced the first dimension by isoelectric focusing in the liquid phase using the Off-Gel device producing 15 fractions. As peptides are separated by their isoelectric point in the first dimension and hydrophobicity in the second, those experimentally derived parameters (pI and R(T)) can be used for the validation of potentially identified peptides. We applied this strategy to a cellular extract of Drosophila Kc167 cells and identified peptides with two different database search engines, namely PHENYX and SEQUEST, with PeptideProphet validation of the SEQUEST results. PHENYX returned 7582 potential peptide identifications and SEQUEST 7629. The SEQUEST results were reduced to 2006 identifications by validation with PeptideProphet. Validation of the PeptideProphet, SEQUEST and PHENYX results by pI and R(T) parameters confirmed 1837 PeptideProphet identifications while in the remainder of the SEQUEST results another 1130 peptides were found to be likely hits. The validation on PHENYX resulted in the fixation of a solid p-value threshold of 95%, and a final count of 2034 highly confident peptide identifications was achieved after pI and R(T) validation. Although the PeptideProphet and PHENYX datasets have a very high confidence the overlap of common identifications was only at 79.4%, to be explained by the fact that data interpretation was done searching different protein databases with two search engines of different algorithms.

In the context of the Proteomics Standards Initiative, we have developed the mzQuantML data standard. The standard can represent quantitative data about regions in two-dimensional retention time versus mass/charge space (called features), peptides, proteins and protein groups - where there is ambiguity in peptide to protein inference, plus limited support for small molecule (metabolomic) data. The format has structures for representing replicate MS runs, grouping of replicates, for example as study variables, and for capturing the parameters used by software packages to arrive at these values. The format has capabilities to reference other standards such as mzML and mzIdentML and thus the evidence trail for the MS workflow as a whole can now be described.

This pathway is of critical importance for the development and progression of prostate cancers. Of clinical importance, modulation of androgens remains the mainstay of treatment for patients with advanced disease. To facilitate global gene expression studies we have first sought to define the prostate transcriptome by assembling and annotating prostate-derived expressed sequence tags (ESTs). A total of 55000 prostate ESTs were assembled into a set of 15953 clusters putatively representing 15953 distinct transcripts. These clusters were used to construct cDNA microarrays suitable for examining the androgen-response pathway at the level of transcription. The expression of 20 genes was found to be induced by androgens. This cohort included known androgen-regulated genes such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and several novel complementary DNAs (cDNAs). Protein expression profiles of androgen-stimulated prostate cancers cells were generated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE).

Although conversion from vendor formats to mzML must take place on a platform on which the vendor libraries are available (i.e. Windows), once mzML files have been generated, they can be used on any platform. However, the mzML format has turned out to be less efficient than vendor formats. In many cases, the naÃŒÃ¸ve mzML representation is fourfold or even up to 18-fold larger compared with the original vendor file. In disk I/O limited setups, a larger data file also leads to longer processing times, which is a problem given the data production rates of modern mass spectrometers. In an attempt to reduce this problem, we here present a family of numerical compression algorithms called MS-Numpress, intended for efficient compression of MS data. To facilitate ease of adoption, the algorithms target the binary data in the mzML standard, and support in main proteomics tools is already available. Using a test set of 10 representative MS data files we demonstrate typical file size decreases of 90% when combined with traditional compression, as well as read time decreases of up to 50%.

These peptides have traditionally been generated by chemical stepwise synthesis. Recently a new way to supply such peptides was described in which nucleotide sequences coding for the respective peptides are concatenated into a synthetic gene (QconCAT). These QconCATs are then expressed to produce a polypeptide consisting of concatenated peptides, purified, quantified by various methods, and then digested to yield the final internal standard peptides. Although both of these methods for peptide production are routinely used for absolute quantifications, there is currently no information regarding the accuracy of the quantifications made in each case. In this study, we used sets of synthetic and biological peptides in parallel to evaluate the accuracy of either method. We also addressed some technical issues regarding the preparation and proper utilization of such standard peptides. Twenty-five peptides derived from the Caenorhabditis elegans proteome were selected for this study. Twenty-four were successfully chemically synthesized. Five QconCAT genes were designed, each a concatenation of the same 25 peptides but each in separate, different randomized order, and expressed via in vitro translation reactions that contained heavy isotope-labeled lysine and arginine. Three of the five QconCATs were successfully produced. Different digestion conditions, including various detergents and incubation conditions, were tested to find those optimal for the generation of a reproducible and accurate reference sample mixture. All three QconCAT polypeptides were then digested using the optimized conditions and then mixed in a 1:1 ratio with their synthetic counterparts. Multireaction monitoring mass spectrometry was then used for quantification. Results showed that the digestion protocol had a significant impact on equimolarity of final peptides, confirming the need for optimization. Under optimal conditions, however, most QconCAT peptides were produced at an equimolar ratio. A few QconCAT-derived peptides were largely overestimated due to problems with solubilization or stability of the synthetic peptides. Although the order in which the peptide sequences appeared in the QconCAT sequence proved to affect the success rate of in vitro translation, it did not significantly affect the final peptide yields. Overall neither the chemical synthesis nor the recombinant genetic approach proved to be superior as a method for the production of reference peptides for absolute quantification.",2008-04,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,813-23,,4,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/chemical synthesis/genetics/metabolism; Genes; Mass Spectrometry/*standards; Peptides/*chemical synthesis/genetics/*metabolism; Proteome/chemical synthesis/genetics/metabolism; Proteomics/*standards; Reference Standards; Synthetic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) 3 is believed to be the immediate precursor lesion of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and would be an ideal stage to diagnose patients, when intervention and cure are possible and patients are curable. In this study, we used quantitative proteomics to identify dysregulated proteins in PanIN 3 lesions. Altogether, over 200 dysregulated proteins were identified in the PanIN 3 tissues, with a minimum of a 1.75-fold change compared with the proteins in normal pancreas. These dysregulated PanIN 3 proteins play roles in cell motility, the inflammatory response, the blood clotting cascade, the cell cycle and its regulation, and protein degradation. Further network analysis of the proteins identified c-MYC as an important regulatory protein in PanIN 3 lesions. Finally, three of the overexpressed proteins, laminin beta-1, galectin-1, and actinin-4 were validated by immunohistochemistry analysis. All three of these proteins were overexpressed in the stroma or ductal epithelial cells of advanced PanIN lesions as well as in pancreatic cancers tissue. Our findings suggest that these three proteins may be useful as biomarkers for advanced PanIN and pancreatic cancers if further validated.

Evidence for in vivo overoxidation of peroxiredoxins at their active site,The Journal of Biological Chemistry,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M106585200,,"The proteomics analysis reported here shows that a major cellular response to oxidative stress is the modification of several peroxiredoxins. An acidic form of the peroxiredoxins appeared to be systematically increased under oxidative stress conditions. Peroxiredoxins are enzymes catalyzing the destruction of peroxides. In doing so, a reactive cysteine in the peroxiredoxin active site is weakly oxidized (disulfide or sulfenic acid) by the destroyed peroxides. Cellular thiols (e.g. thioredoxin) are used to regenerate the peroxiredoxins to their active state. Tandem mass spectrometry was carried out to characterize the modified form of the protein produced in vivo by oxidative stress. The cysteine present in the active site was shown to be oxidized into cysteic acid, leading to an inactivated form of peroxiredoxin. This strongly suggested that peroxiredoxins behave as a dam upon oxidative stress, being both important peroxide-destroying enzymes and peroxide targets. Results obtained in a primary culture of Leydig cells challenged with tumor necrosis factor alpha suggested that this oxidized/native balance of peroxiredoxin 2 may play an active role in resistance or susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced apoptosis.",5/31/02,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,19396-401,,22,277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Oxidative Stress; Animals; Apoptosis; Binding Sites; Cysteine/chemistry; Humans; Jurkat Cells; Mass; Mass Spectrometry; Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Oxygen/*metabolism; Peptides/chemistry; Peroxidases/*chemistry/metabolism; Peroxiredoxins; Protein Binding; Spectrometry; Swine; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because blood circulates the entire body and carries secreted, shed and excreted signature proteins from every organ and tissue type, it is thus possible of using blood proteome to achieve a comprehensive assessment of multiple-organ physiology and pathology. To date, blood proteome has been frequently examined for diseases of individual organs; studies on compound insults impacting multiple organs are, however, elusive. We believe that a characterization of peripheral blood for organ-specific proteins affords a powerful strategy to allow early detection, staging and monitoring of diseases and their treatments at a whole-body level. In this paper we test this hypothesis by examining a mouse model of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatic and extrahepatic toxicity. We used glycocapture-assisted global quantitative proteomics (gagQP) approach to study serum proteins and validated our results using Western blot. We discovered in mouse sera both hepatic and extrahepatic organ-specific proteins. From our validation, selected organ-specific proteins had changed their blood concentration during the course of toxicity development and recovery. Interestingly, the peak responding time of proteins specific to different organs varied in a time-course study. The collected molecular information shed light on a complex, dynamic yet interweaving, multiorgan-enrolled APAP toxicity. The developed technique as well as the identified protein markers is translational to human studies.

We sought to optimize loading methods by testing multiple loading conditions (buffer composition, resin, initial gradient) using tryptic digests of an 18 protein mixture and whole yeast lysate. The loading buffer acetonitrile (ACN) concentration greatly affected peptide identifications: up to a 26% increase in peptide identifications was observed by decreasing the ACN concentration from 5 to 2% during sample loading. Hydrophilic peptides were the main contributors to the increase in peptide identifications and, at higher ACN concentrations, were washed from the precolumn during desalting. Sampling of the hydrophilic peptides was enhanced by using a shallow initial ACN gradient. The results were found to be resin-specific and not generalizable.

Although there is extensive evidence for large scale alternative splicing at the transcript level, there have been no comparable studies demonstrating the existence of alternatively spliced protein isoforms. RESULTS: Recent advances in proteomics technology have allowed us to carry out a comprehensive identification of protein isoforms in Drosophila. The analysis of this proteomic data confirmed the presence of multiple alternative gene products for over a hundred Drosophila genes. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that proteomics techniques can detect the expression of stable alternative splice isoforms on a genome-wide scale. Many of these alternative isoforms are likely to have regions that are disordered in solution, and specific proteomics methodologies may be required to identify these peptides.",2008,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,R162,,11,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Alternative Splicing; *Genome; Animals; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins/*analysis/*genetics; Insect; Phosphopeptides/analysis; Protein Isoforms/analysis/genetics; Proteomics/*methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We, therefore, undertook a comprehensive analysis of the EPS proteome using 2-D micro-LC combined with MS/MS.

The simple approach of target-decoy searching has become popular with traditional sequence (database) searching methods, but has yet to be practiced in spectral (library) searching, an emerging alternative to sequence searching. We extended this target-decoy searching approach to spectral searching by developing and validating a robust method to generate realistic, but unnatural, decoy spectra. Our method involves randomly shuffling the peptide identification of each reference spectrum in the library, and repositioning each fragment ion peak along the m/z axis to match the fragment ions expected from the shuffled sequence. We show that this method produces decoy spectra that are sufficiently realistic, such that incorrect identifications are equally likely to match real and decoy spectra, a key assumption necessary for decoy counting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PSI has 5 categories of deliverables that have guided the group. These are minimum information guidelines, data formats, controlled vocabularies, resources and software tools, and dissemination activities. These deliverables are produced via the leadership and working group organization of the initiative, driven by frequent workshops and ongoing communication within the working groups. Official standards are subjected to a rigorous document process that includes several levels of peer review prior to release. RESULTS: We have produced and published minimum information guidelines describing what information should be provided when making data public, either via public repositories or other means. The PSI has produced a series of standard formats covering mass spectrometer input, mass spectrometer output, results of informatics analysis (both qualitative and quantitative analyses), reports of molecular interaction data, and gel electrophoresis analyses. We have produced controlled vocabularies that ensure that concepts are uniformly annotated in the formats and engaged in extensive software development and dissemination efforts so that the standards can efficiently be used by the community. Conclusion In its first dozen years of operation, the PSI has produced many standards that have accelerated the field of proteomics by facilitating data exchange and deposition to data repositories. We look to the future to continue developing standards for new proteomics technologies and workflows and mechanisms for integration with other omics data types.

For example, the development of disease-related biomarker panels will require fast and efficient methods for obtaining multiparameter protein profiles. We established a high throughput, label-free method for analyzing serum using surface plasmon resonance imaging of antibody microarrays. Microarrays were fabricated using standard pin spotting on bare gold substrates, and samples were applied for binding analysis using a camera-based surface plasmon resonance system. We validated the system by measuring the concentrations of four serum proteins using part of a 792-feature microarray. Transferrin concentrations were measured to be 2.1 mg/ml in human serum and 1.2 mg/ml in murine serum, which closely matched ELISA determinations of 2.6 and 1.2 mg/ml, respectively. In agreement with expected values, human and mouse albumin levels were measured to be 24.3 and 23.6 mg/ml, respectively. The lower limits of detection for the four measurements ranged from 14 to 58 ng/ml or 175 to 755 pm. Where purified target proteins are not available for calibration, the microarrays can be used for relative protein quantification. We used the antibody microarray to compare the serum protein profiles from three liver cancers patients and three non-liver cancers patients. Hierarchical clustering of the serum protein levels clearly distinguished two distinct profiles. Thirty-nine significant protein changes were detected (p < 0.05), 10 of which have been observed previously in serum. alpha-Fetoprotein, a known liver cancers marker, was observed to increase. These results demonstrate the feasibility of this high throughput approach for both absolute and relative protein expression profiling.",2008-12,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,2464-74,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Antibodies; Blood Proteins; Cluster Analysis; Cross Reactions; Humans; Kinetics; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Neoplasm; Protein Array Analysis; Proteomics; Sensitivity and Specificity; Surface Plasmon Resonance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A promising approach to developing a malaria vaccine is the use of proteins located on the sporozoite surface as antigens to elicit humoral immune responses that prevent the establishment of infection. Very little of the P. falciparum genome has been considered as potential vaccine targets, and candidate vaccines have been almost exclusively based on single antigens, generating the need for novel target identification. The most advanced malaria vaccine to date, RTS,S, a subunit vaccine consisting of a portion of the major surface protein circumsporozoite protein (CSP), conferred limited protection in Phase III trials, falling short of community-established vaccine efficacy goals. In striking contrast to the limited protection seen in current vaccine trials, sterilizing immunity can be achieved by immunization with radiation-attenuated sporozoites, suggesting that more potent protection may be achievable with a multivalent protein vaccine. Here, we provide the most comprehensive analysis to date of proteins located on the surface of or secreted by Plasmodium falciparum salivary gland sporozoites. We used chemical labeling to isolate surface-exposed proteins on sporozoites and identified these proteins by mass spectrometry. We validated several of these targets and also provide evidence that components of the inner membrane complex are in fact surface-exposed and accessible to antibodies in live sporozoites.

In order to maximize proteome coverage for the studied sample, i.e. identify as many traceable proteins as possible, LC-MS/MS experiments are typically repeated extensively and the results combined. Proteome coverage prediction is the task of estimating the number of peptide discoveries of future LC-MS/MS experiments. Proteome coverage prediction is important to enhance the design of efficient proteomics studies. To date, there does not exist any method to reliably estimate the increase of proteome coverage at an early stage. RESULTS: We propose an extended infinite Markov model DiriSim to extrapolate the progression of proteome coverage based on a small number of already performed LC-MS/MS experiments. The method explicitly accounts for the uncertainty of peptide identifications. We tested DiriSim on a set of 37 LC-MS/MS experiments of a complete proteome sample and demonstrated that DiriSim correctly predicts the coverage progression already from a small subset of experiments. The predicted progression enabled us to specify maximal coverage for the test sample.

We developed and validated an MS data acquisition strategy using this new reagent that results in an increased number of protein identifications per experiment, without losing the accuracy of protein quantification.

This strategy is common to many high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization (HPLC-ESI)-MS shotgun proteomic strategies, but heretofore not to ICAT experiments.

Although formerly regarded as extracellular pathogen, it has been shown that S. aureus can also be internalized by host cells and persist within these cells. In the present study, we comparatively analyzed survival and physiological adaptation of S. aureus HG001 after internalization by two human lung epithelial cell lines (S9 and A549), and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293). Combining enrichment of bacteria from host-pathogen assays by cell sorting and quantitation of the pathogen's proteome by mass spectrometry we characterized S. aureus adaptation during the initial phase between 2.5 h and 6.5 h post-infection. Starting with about 2 ÃŒÃ‘ 10(6) bacteria, roughly 1450 S. aureus proteins, including virulence factors and metabolic enzymes were identified by spectral comparison and classical database searches. Most of the bacterial adaptation reactions, such as decreased levels of ribosomal proteins and metabolic enzymes or increased amounts of proteins involved in arginine and lysine biosynthesis, enzymes coding for terminal oxidases and stress responsive proteins or activation of the sigma factor SigB were observed after internalization into any of the three cell lines studied. However, differences were noted in central carbon metabolism including regulation of fermentation and threonine degradation. Since these differences coincided with different intracellular growth behavior, complementary profiling of the metabolome of the different non-infected host cell types was performed. This revealed similar levels of intracellular glucose but host cell specific differences in the amounts of amino acids such as glycine, threonine or glutamate. With this comparative study we provide an impression of the common and specific features of the adaptation of S. aureus HG001 to specific host cell environments as a starting point for follow-up studies with different strain isolates and regulatory mutants.",2014,2/5/16 22:15,2/9/16 0:19,,392,,,5,,Front Microbiol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 25136337 PMCID: PMC4117987,,,,,host-pathogen interaction; human cell lines; label-free quantitation; Proteomics; Staphylococcus aureus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the biochemical activities of the organism, the proteomic data were subjected to a biological network analysis using our BMSorter software. This allowed us to examine the proteins expressed in different biomodules and study the interactions between pertinent biomodules. Interestingly an integrated analysis of the enzymes in the amino acid metabolism and citrate cycle networks suggested that up to eight amino acids may be converted to oxaloacetate, fumarate, or oxoglutarate in the citrate cycle for energy production. In addition, glutamate and aspartate may be interconverted from other amino acids or synthesized from citrate cycle intermediates to meet the high demand for the acidic amino acids that are required to build the highly acidic proteome of the organism.

The currency of proteome analysis by mass spectrometry is the peptides generated by protein proteolysis. The high sample complexity of such samples requires a large separation capacity, which is commonly achieved by fractionation of the mixture followed by further serial separations of each fraction. The sample throughput of proteome analysis is therefore limited by the need to sequentially process large numbers of samples. We have developed a novel four-plexed microcapillary liquid chromatography system for automated, high-throughput separation of complex peptide samples. The system supports the concurrent separation of four different samples by directing identically split solvent-gradient flows into four microcapillary C18 columns. The simple design of the system achieves multiplexed separation without the need for extra solvent pumps. Peak resolution, reproducibility, and parallel separating capacity of the system were investigated using standard peptides. The applicability of the system to high-throughput protein expression profiling was demonstrated in qualitative and quantitative analyses of protein expression in S. cerevisiae grown on two different carbon sources using the isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) reagent and matrix-assisted desorption/ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.",9/1/02,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,4353-60,,17,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chromatography; Gene Expression Profiling; High Pressure Liquid/*instrumentation/standards; Microchemistry/instrumentation; Peptides/analysis/standards; Proteome/*analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/chemistry/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current methods, while highly developed and powerful, are falling short of their goal of routinely analyzing whole proteomes mainly because the wealth of proteomic information accumulated from prior studies is not used for the planning or interpretation of present experiments. The consequence of this situation is that in every proteomic experiment the proteome is rediscovered. In this report we describe an approach for quantitative proteomics that builds on the extensive prior knowledge of proteomes and a platform for the implementation of the method. The method is based on the selection and chemical synthesis of isotopically labeled reference peptides that uniquely identify a particular protein and the addition of a panel of such peptides to the sample mixture consisting of tryptic peptides from the proteome in question.

However, important research directions, particularly those involving mathematical modelling and simulation of biological processes, also critically depend on absolutely quantitative dataâ€°Ã›Ã’that is, knowledge of the concentration of the expressed proteins as a function of cellular state. Until now, absolute protein concentration measurements of a considerable fraction of the proteome (73%) have only been derived from genetically altered Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, a technique that is not directly portable from yeast to other species. Here we present a mass-spectrometry-based strategy to determine the absolute quantity, that is, the average number of protein copies per cell in a cell population, for a large fraction of the proteome in genetically unperturbed cells. Applying the technology to the human pathogen Leptospira interrogans, a spirochete responsible for leptospirosis, we generated an absolute protein abundance scale for 83% of the mass-spectrometry-detectable proteome, from cells at different states. Taking advantage of the unique cellular dimensions of L. interrogans, we used cryo-electron tomography morphological measurements to verify, at the single-cell level, the average absolute abundance values of selected proteins determined by mass spectrometry on a population of cells. Because the strategy is relatively fast and applicable to any cell type, we expect that it will become a cornerstone of quantitative biology and systems biology.",8/6/09,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,762-5,,7256,460,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bacterial Proteins/*analysis/metabolism; Chromatography; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Electron Microscope Tomography; High Pressure Liquid; Humans; Leptospira interrogans/cytology/*metabolism; Liquid/methods; Mass; Mass Spectrometry/*methods; Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Proteome/*analysis/metabolism; Proteomics/*methods; Spectrometry; Tandem Mass Spectrometry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have defined the chromosome 17 parts list with the following information: 1169 protein-coding genes, the numbers of proteins confidently identified by various experimental approaches as documented in GPMDB, neXtProt, PeptideAtlas, and HPA, examples of typical data sets obtained by RNASeq and proteomic studies of epithelial derived tumor cell lines (disease proteome) and a normal proteome (peripheral mononuclear cells), reported evidence of post-translational modifications, and examples of alternative splice variants (ASVs). We have constructed a list of the 59 ""missing"" proteins as well as 201 proteins that have inconclusive mass spectrometric (MS) identifications. In this report we have defined a process to establish a baseline for the incorporation of new evidence on protein identification and characterization as well as related information from transcriptome analyses. This initial list of ""missing"" proteins that will guide the selection of appropriate samples for discovery studies as well as antibody reagents. Also we have illustrated the significant diversity of protein variants (including post-translational modifications, PTMs) using regions on chromosome 17 that contain important oncogenes.

Formation of LCVs requires the bacterial Icm/Dot type IV secretion system. The Icm/Dot-translocated effector protein SidC selectively anchors to LCVs by binding the host lipid phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P). Here, we describe a novel and simple approach to purify intact vacuoles formed by L. pneumophila within Dictyostelium discoideum by using magnetic immunoseparation with an antibody against SidC, followed by density gradient centrifugation. To monitor LCV purification by fluorescence microscopy, we used Dictyostelium producing the LCV marker calnexin-GFP and L. pneumophila labeled with the red fluorescent protein DsRed. A proteome analysis of purified LCVs by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry revealed 566 host proteins, including known LCV components, such as the small GTPases Arf1, Rab1 and Rab7. Rab8, an endosomal regulator of the late secretory pathway originating from the trans Golgi network, and the endosomal GTPase Rab14 were identified as novel LCV components, which were found to be present on vacuoles harboring wild-type but not Icm/Dot-deficient L. pneumophila. Thus, LCVs also communicate with the late secretory and endosomal pathways. Depletion of Rab8 or Arf1 by RNA interference reduced the amount of SidC on LCVs, indicating that the GTPases promote the recruitment of Legionella effectors by regulating the level of PtdIns(4)P.",2009-01,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,76-87,,1,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Secretory Pathway; Animals; Dictyostelium/metabolism; Endosomes/*metabolism; GTP Phosphohydrolases/*metabolism; Immunologic Techniques; Legionella pneumophila/genetics/*metabolism; Magnetics; Phagocytes/metabolism; Proteome/*analysis/*metabolism; Vacuoles/*enzymology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these databases lack information about human disease for researchers studying disease-related proteins. We have developed mspecLINE, a tool that combines knowledge about human disease in MEDLINE with empirical data about the detectable human proteome in PeptideAtlas. mspecLINE associates diseases with proteins by calculating the semantic distance between annotated terms from a controlled biomedical vocabulary. We used an established semantic distance measure that is based on the co-occurrence of disease and protein terms in the MEDLINE bibliographic database. RESULTS: The mspecLINE web application allows researchers to explore relationships between human diseases and parts of the proteome that are detectable using a mass spectrometer. Given a disease, the tool will display proteins and peptides from PeptideAtlas that may be associated with the disease. It will also display relevant literature from MEDLINE. Furthermore, mspecLINE allows researchers to select proteotypic peptides for specific protein targets in a mass spectrometry assay. CONCLUSIONS: Although mspecLINE applies an information retrieval technique to the MEDLINE database, it is distinct from previous MEDLINE query tools in that it combines the knowledge expressed in scientific literature with empirical proteomics data.

The results led to the construction of a cell surface glycoprotein atlas consisting of 202 cell surface glycoproteins of D. melanogaster Kc167 cells and indicated relative quantitative changes of cell surface glycoproteins in four different cellular states. Furthermore we specifically investigated cell surface proteome changes upon prolonged insulin stimulation. The data revealed insulin-dependent cell surface glycoprotein dynamics, including insulin receptor internalization, and linked these changes to intracellular signaling networks.",2009-04,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,624-38,,4,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Isotope Labeling; Animals; Cell Line; Cell Membrane/drug effects/*metabolism; Chromatography; Drosophila melanogaster/*cytology/*metabolism; Drosophila Proteins/metabolism; Endocytosis/drug effects; Glycoproteins/analysis; Insulin/metabolism; Insulin/pharmacology; Liquid; Mass Spectrometry/*methods; Proteome/*analysis; Receptor; Reproducibility of Results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell culture and transgenic studies indicate that the Trex site is important for MCK expression in skeletal and cardiac muscle. After selectively enriching for the Trex-binding factor (TrexBF) using magnetic beads coupled to oligonucleotides containing either wild-type or mutant Trex sites, quantitative proteomics was used to identify TrexBF as Six4, a homeodomain transcription factor of the Six/sine oculis family, from a background of approximately 900 copurifying proteins. Using gel shift assays and Six-specific antisera, we demonstrated that Six4 is TrexBF in mouse skeletal myocytes and embryonic day 10 chick skeletal and cardiac muscle, while Six5 is the major TrexBF in adult mouse heart. In cotransfection studies, Six4 transactivates the MCK enhancer as well as muscle-specific regulatory regions of Aldolase A and Cardiac troponin C via Trex/MEF3 sites. Our results are consistent with Six4 being a key regulator of muscle gene expression in adult skeletal muscle and in developing striated muscle.

This network supports the flow of information from sensors through signaling systems to effector molecules and ultimately drives the phenotype and function of cells, tissues, and organisms. Dysregulation of this process has severe consequences and is one of the main factors in the emergence and progression of diseases, including cancers. Thus, major efforts have been invested in developing specific inhibitors that modulate the activity of individual kinases or phosphatases; however, it has been difficult to assess how such pharmacological interventions would affect the cellular signaling network as a whole. Here, we used label-free, quantitative phosphoproteomics in a systematically perturbed model organism (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to determine the relationships between 97 kinases, 27 phosphatases, and more than 1000 phosphoproteins. We identified 8814 regulated phosphorylation events, describing the first system-wide protein phosphorylation network in vivo. Our results show that, at steady state, inactivation of most kinases and phosphatases affected large parts of the phosphorylation-modulated signal transduction machinery-and not only the immediate downstream targets. The observed cellular growth phenotype was often well maintained despite the perturbations, arguing for considerable robustness in the system. Our results serve to constrain future models of cellular signaling and reinforce the idea that simple linear representations of signaling pathways might be insufficient for drug development and for describing organismal homeostasis.",2010,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,rs4,,153,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For analyses in which high protein coverage is desirable, such as global monitoring of post-translational modifications, additional sequences can be seen using parallel digestion with a second enzyme. We have benchmarked a relatively obscure basidomycete-derived zinc metalloendopeptidase, Lys-N, that selectively cleaves the amide bond N-terminal of lysine residues. We have found that Lys-N digestion yields peptides with easily assigned CID spectra. Using a mixture of purified proteins as well as a complex yeast lysate, we have shown that Lys-N efficiently digests all proteins at the predicted sites of cleavage. Shotgun proteomics analyses of Lys-N digests of both the standard mixture and yeast lysate yielded peptide and protein identification numbers that were generally comparable to trypsin digestion, whereas the combination data from Lys-N and trypsin digestion substantially enhanced protein coverage. During CID fragmentation, the additional amino terminal basicity enhanced b-ion intensity which was reflected in long b-ion tags that were particularly pronounced during CID in a quadrupole. Finally, immonium ion peaks produced from Lys-N digested peptides originate from the carboxy terminus in contrast to tryptic peptides where immonium ions originate from the amino terminus.",2009-03,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,1415-22,,3,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fungal Proteins/metabolism; Grifola/*enzymology; Lysine/*metabolism; Metalloexopeptidases/*metabolism; Peptides/*metabolism; Proteome/*metabolism; Trypsin/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One defined early adaptation is expression of a specific proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is associated with antimicrobial peptide resistance. This CF-specific LPS is induced when P. aeruginosa is grown in medium that is limited for magnesium. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative proteomic approaches were used to define 1,331 P. aeruginosa proteins, of which 145 were differentially expressed on limitation of magnesium. Among proteins induced by low magnesium were enzymes essential for production of 2-heptyl 3-hydroxy 4-quinolone, the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), which interacts with the homoserine lactone signaling pathway.

After selectively enriching for MPEX-binding factor(s) (MPEX-BFs), ICAT-based quantitative proteomics was used to identify MPEX-BF candidates, one of which was MAZ (Myc-associated zinc finger protein). MAZ transactivates the MCK promoter and binds the MPEX site in vitro, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates enrichment of MAZ at the endogenous MCK promoter and other muscle gene promoters (Skeletal alpha-actin, Desmin, and alpha-Myosin heavy chain) in skeletal and cardiac myocytes. Consistent with its role in muscle gene transcription, MAZ transcripts and DNA-binding activity are upregulated during skeletal myocyte differentiation. Furthermore, MAZ was shown to bind numerous sequences (e.g., CTCCTCCC and CTCCACCC) that diverge from the GA box binding motif. Alternate motifs were identified in many muscle promoters, including Myogenin and MEF2C, and one motif was shown to be critical for Six4 promoter activity in both skeletal and cardiac myocytes.

Developed as an open study, initially 64 participants were recruited from the broader mass spectrometry community to analyze provided aliquots of a six bovine protein tryptic digest mixture every month for a period of nine months. Data were uploaded to a central repository, and the operators answered an accompanying survey. Ultimately, 45 laboratories submitted a minimum of eight LC-MSMS raw data files collected in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. No standard operating procedures were enforced; rather the participants were encouraged to analyze the samples according to usual practices in the laboratory. Unlike previous studies, this investigation was not designed to compare laboratories or instrument configuration, but rather to assess the temporal intralaboratory reproducibility. The outcome of the study was reassuring with 80% of the participating laboratories performing analyses at a medium to high level of reproducibility and quality over the 9-month period. For the groups that had one or more outlying experiments, the major contributing factor that correlated to the survey data was the performance of preventative maintenance prior to the LC-MSMS analyses. Thus, the Protein Research Group of the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities recommends that laboratories closely scrutinize the quality control data following such events. Additionally, improved quality control recording is imperative. This longitudinal study provides evidence that mass spectrometry-based proteomics is reproducible. When quality control measures are strictly adhered to, such reproducibility is comparable among many disparate groups.

Proteins are one class of potential biomarkers currently under investigation in the hope that different ensembles of proteins will aid in the diagnosis of these diseases, as well as in the assessment of progression and response to therapy. However, before undertaking a rational approach to CSF protein biomarkers of age-related neurodegeneration, we must first systematically identify CSF proteins and determine whether their levels change with normal aging. In this study, we used a powerful shotgun proteomic method, two-dimensional microcapillary liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, to identify proteins in human CSF. Additionally, using pooled CSF samples, we quantitatively compared the CSF proteome of younger adults with that of older adults using isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT). From these studies we identified more than 300 proteins in CSF and found that there were 30 proteins with >20% change in concentrations between older and younger individuals.

The overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a primary influencer of invasion and proliferation in tumor cells and the constitutively active EGFRvIII mutant, found in 30-65% of Glioblastoma multiforme, confers more aggressive invasion. To better understand how EGFR contributes to tumor aggressiveness, we investigated the effect of EGFR on the secreted levels of 65 rationally selected proteins involved in invasion. We employed selected reaction monitoring targeted mass spectrometry using stable isotope labeled internal peptide standards to quantity proteins in the secretome from five GBM (U87) isogenic cell lines in which EGFR, EGFRvIII, and/or PTEN were expressed. Our results show that cell lines with EGFR overexpression and constitutive EGFRvIII expression differ remarkably in the expression profiles for both secreted and intracellular signaling proteins, and alterations in EGFR signaling result in reproducible changes in concentrations of secreted proteins. Furthermore, the EGFRvIII-expressing mutant cell line secretes the majority of the selected invasion-promoting proteins at higher levels than other cell lines tested. Additionally, the intracellular and extracellular protein measurements indicate elevated oxidative stress in the EGFRvIII-expressing cell line. In conclusion, the results of our study demonstrate that EGFR signaling has a significant effect on the levels of secreted invasion-promoting proteins, likely contributing to the aggressiveness of Glioblastoma multiforme.

Furthermore, a multitude of search engines have been developed that identify different, overlapping subsets of the sample peptides from a particular set of MS/MS spectra. We present iProphet, the new addition to the widely used open-source suite of proteomic data analysis tools Trans-Proteomics Pipeline (TPP). Applied in tandem with PeptideProphet, it provides more accurate representation of the multi-level nature of shotgun proteomic data. iProphet combines the evidence from multiple identifications of the same peptide sequences across different spectra, experiments, precursor ion charge states, and modified states. It also allows accurate and effective integration of the results from multiple database search engines applied to the same data. The use of iProphet in the TPP increases the number of correctly identified peptides at a constant false discovery rate (FDR) as compared to both PeptideProphet and another state-of-the-art tool Percolator. As the main outcome, iProphet permits the calculation of accurate posterior probabilities and FDR estimates at the level of sequence identical peptide identifications, which in turn leads to more accurate probability estimates at the protein level. Fully integrated with the TPP, it supports all commonly used MS instruments, search engines and computer platforms.

Therefore, the determination of their true cellular localization requires the concurrent analysis of multiple organelles from the same cell lysate. Here, we report an integrated experimental approach that simultaneously profiles multiple organelles. It is based on the subcellular fractionation of cell lysates by density gradient centrifugation, iTRAQ labeling, and MS analysis of the proteins in selected fractions and principal component analysis (PCA) of the resulting quantitative proteomic data. Quantitative signature patterns of several organelles, including the ribosome, mitochondria, proteasome, lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Golgi apparatus, have been acquired from a single multiplexed proteomic assay using iTRAQ reagents. Through comparison PCA, we compare organelle profiles from cells under different physiological conditions to investigate changes in organelle profiles between control and perturbed samples. Such quantitative proteomics-based subcellular profiling methods thus provide useful tools to dissect the organization of cellular proteins into functional units and to detect dynamic changes in their protein composition.",2008,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,389-401,,,432,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Proteome; Animals; Cell Fractionation/methods; Cell Line; Chromatography; Computational Biology; Ion Exchange/methods; Liquid/methods; Macrophages/cytology; Mass Spectrometry/methods; Mice; Organelles/*chemistry; Proteins/*chemistry/*isolation & purification; Trypsin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this approach has been widely and successfully used it is limited because it has difficulties reliably discriminating true from false protein complex components, identifying post-translational modifications, and detecting quantitative changes in complex composition or state of modification of complex components. We have developed a protocol that enables us to determine, in a single LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis, the true protein constituents of a complex, to detect changes in the complex composition, and to localize phosphorylation sites and estimate their respective stoichiometry. The method is based on the combination of fourplex iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) isobaric labeling and protein phosphatase treatment of substrates. It was evaluated on model peptides and proteins and on the complex Ccl1-Kin28-Tfb3 isolated by tandem affinity purification from yeast cells. The two known phosphosites in Kin28 and Tfb3 could be reproducibly shown to be fully modified. The protocol was then applied to the analysis of samples immunopurified from Drosophila melanogaster cells expressing an epitope-tagged form of the insulin receptor substrate homologue Chico. These experiments allowed us to identify 14-3-3epsilon, 14-3-3zeta, and the insulin receptor as specific Chico interactors. In a further experiment, we compared the immunopurified materials obtained from tagged Chico-expressing cells that were either treated with insulin or left unstimulated. This analysis showed that hormone stimulation increases the association of 14-3-3 proteins with Chico and modulates several phosphorylation sites of the bait, some of which are located within predicted recognition motives of 14-3-3 proteins.",2008-02,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,326-46,,2,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Angiotensin II/chemistry; Animals; Drosophila melanogaster/chemistry; Drosophila Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification; Humans; Mass; Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphopeptides/analysis/chemistry; Phosphoproteins/chemistry; Phosphorylation; Protein Binding; Proteins/*analysis/chemistry; Proteomics/*methods; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/chemistry; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification; Spectrometry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analytic software must solve the dichotomy that exists between the need to allow for a high level of scientific reasoning, and the requirement to have an intuitive and easy to use tool which does not require specialist, and often arduous, training to use. Information visualization provides a solution to this problem, as it allows for direct manipulation and interaction with diverse and complex data. The challenge addressing bioinformatics researches is how to apply this knowledge to data sets that are continually growing in a field that is rapidly changing. RESULTS: This paper discusses an approach to the development of visual mining tools capable of supporting the mining of massive data collections used in systems biology research, and also discusses lessons that have been learned providing tools for both local researchers and the wider community. Example tools were developed which are designed to enable the exploration and analyses of both proteomics and genomics based atlases. These atlases represent large repositories of raw and processed experiment data generated to support the identification of biomarkers through mass spectrometry (the PeptideAtlas) and the genomic characterization of cancers (The cancers Genome Atlas). Specifically the tools are designed to allow for: the visual mining of thousands of mass spectrometry experiments, to assist in designing informed targeted protein assays; and the interactive analysis of hundreds of genomes, to explore the variations across different cancers genomes and cancers types. CONCLUSIONS: The mining of massive repositories of biological data requires the development of new tools and techniques. Visual exploration of the large-scale atlas data sets allows researchers to mine data to find new meaning and make sense at scales from single samples to entire populations. Providing linked task specific views that allow a user to start from points of interest (from diseases to single genes) enables targeted exploration of thousands of spectra and genomes. As the composition of the atlases changes, and our understanding of the biology increase, new tasks will continually arise. It is therefore important to provide the means to make the data available in a suitable manner in as short a time as possible. We have done this through the use of common visualization workflows, into which we rapidly deploy visual tools. These visualizations follow common metaphors where possible to assist users in understanding the displayed data. Rapid development of tools and task specific views allows researchers to mine large-scale data almost as quickly as it is produced. Ultimately these visual tools enable new inferences, new analyses and further refinement of the large scale data being provided in atlases such as PeptideAtlas and The cancers Genome Atlas.",2012,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,58,,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For quantitative analysis, whole cell and membrane proteins were differentially labeled with isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) reagents and ICAT reagent-labeled peptides were separated by two-dimensional chromatography prior to analysis by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) in an ion trap mass spectrometer (ITMS). To increase the number of protein identifications, gas-phase fractionation (GPF) in the m/z dimension was employed for analysis of ICAT peptides derived from whole cell extracts. The experiments confirmed expression of 1331 P. aeruginosa proteins of which 145 were differentially expressed upon limitation of magnesium. A number of conserved Gram-negative magnesium stress-response proteins involved in bacterial virulence were among the most abundant proteins induced in low magnesium. Comparative ICAT analysis of membrane versus whole cell protein indicated that growth of P. aeruginosa in low magnesium resulted in altered subcellular compartmentalization of large enzyme complexes such as ribosomes. This result was confirmed by 2-D PAGE analysis of P. aeruginosa outer membrane proteins.

Thus determination of the site(s) of protein phosphorylation has been an essential step in the analysis of the control of many biological systems. However, direct determination of individual phosphorylation sites occurring on phosphoproteins in vivo has been difficult to date, typically requiring the purification to homogeneity of the phosphoprotein of interest before analysis. Thus, there has been a substantial need for a more rapid and general method for the analysis of protein phosphorylation in complex protein mixtures. Here we describe such an approach to protein phosphorylation analysis. It consists of three steps: (1) selective phosphopeptide isolation from a peptide mixture via a sequence of chemical reactions, (2) phosphopeptide analysis by automated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and (3) identification of the phosphoprotein and the phosphorylated residue(s) by correlation of tandem mass spectrometric data with sequence databases. By utilizing various phosphoprotein standards and a whole yeast cell lysate, we demonstrate that the method is equally applicable to serine-, threonine- and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, and is capable of selectively isolating and identifying phosphopeptides present in a highly complex peptide mixture.",2001-04,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,375-8,,4,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Biochemistry/*methods; Caseins/chemistry; Chemical; Databases; Factual; Fungal Proteins/chemistry; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/methods; Glucose/chemistry; Glutathione Transferase/metabolism; Mass Spectrometry/methods; Models; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptides/*chemistry/*isolation & purification; Phosphorylation; Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/enzymology; Serine/chemistry; Threonine/chemistry; Time Factors; Tyrosine/chemistry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following brief descriptions of how proteins are identified using MS, and general protein complex purification approaches, we address two of the most important issues in these types of studies: specificity and background protein contaminants. Two basic strategies for increasing specificity and decreasing background are presented: whereas (1) tandem affinity purification (TAP) of tagged proteins of interest can dramatically improve the signal-to-noise ratio via the generation of cleaner samples, (2) stable isotopic labelling of proteins may be used to discriminate between contaminants and bona fide binding partners using quantitative MS techniques.

Pex25p is related to a protein of unknown function encoded by the open reading frame, YOR193w, of the S. cerevisiae genome. Yor193p is a peripheral peroxisomal membrane protein that exhibits high sequence similarity not only to Pex25p but also to the peroxisomal membrane peroxin Pex11p.

Measurement of these proteins in nuclear extracts by SRM permitted the reproducible quantification of 42% of the proteins over a wide range of abundances. By deploying the assay to systematically identify DNA binding transcriptional regulators that interact with the environmentally regulated FLO11 promoter in cell extracts, we identified 15 regulators that bound specifically to distinct regions along approximately 600 bp of the regulatory sequence. Importantly, the dataset includes a number of regulators that have been shown to either control FLO11 expression or localize to these regulatory regions in vivo. We further validated the utility of the approach by demonstrating that two of the SRM-identified factors, Mot3 and Azf1, are required for proper FLO11 expression.

A number of miRNAs have been found to be present in plasma and other body fluids of humans and mice in surprisingly high concentrations. This observation was unexpected in two respects: first, the fact that these molecules are present at all outside the cell at significant concentrations and second, that these molecules appear to be stable outside of the cell. In light of this it has been suggested that the biological function of miRNAs may also extend outside of the cell and mediate cell-cell communication. We report here that after serum deprivation several human cell lines tested promptly export a substantial amount of miRNAs into the culture medium and the export process is largely energy dependent. The exported miRNAs are found both within and outside of the 16.5 and 120 K centrifugation pellets which contain most of the known cell-derived vesicles, the microvesicles and exosomes. We have identified some candidate proteins involved in this system, and one of these proteins may also play a role in protecting extracellular miRNAs from degradation.

PP4cs is comprised of the catalytic subunit PP4C; a known regulatory subunit, PP4R2; and a novel protein that we termed PP4R3. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae PP4R3 ortholog Psy2 was identified previously in a screen for sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent and anticancers drug cisplatin. We demonstrated that deletion of any of the PP4cs complex orthologs in S. cerevisiae elicited cisplatin hypersensitivity. Furthermore human PP4R3 complemented the yeast psy2 deletion, and Drosophila melanogaster lacking functional PP4R3 (flfl) exhibited cisplatin hypersensitivity, suggesting a highly conserved role for PP4cs in DNA damage repair. Finally we found that PP4R3 may target PP4cs to the DNA damage repair machinery at least in part via an interaction with Rad53 (CHK2).",2005-11,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,1725-40,,11,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Conserved Sequence; *Evolution; Biological; Cell Line; Cisplatin/*pharmacology; DNA Damage; Drug Hypersensitivity; Humans; Models; Molecular; Multiprotein Complexes/chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism; Mutation/genetics; Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/chemistry/genetics/isolation &; Protein Binding; purification/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/cytology/growth & development/metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/analysis/metabolism; Sequence Alignment; Two-Hybrid System Techniques,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the mechanisms by which the H3 tail modulates transcription are not well understood, recent discoveries of specific interactions of regulatory factors with H3 tails suggest that H3 tails are a key player in the precise regulation of transcription activity. To investigate the recruitment-based action of H3 tails in chromatin transcription, we purified H3 tail-associated proteins from HeLa cells that stably express epitope-tagged H3 tails. This approach resulted in the identification of multiple histone methyltransferase activities and transcription regulatory factors that are specifically associated with expressed H3 tail domains. Point mutations of Lys-9 and Lys-27 to block cellular modifications of the tail domains completely abolished the association of specific factors, including HP1 and several repressors. Importantly, our transcription analysis revealed that the purified factors can significantly stimulate p300-mediated transcription from chromatin templates.

Using proteomic, genomic, and gene-specific analyses, we demonstrate that a large repertoire of DNA-binding transcription factors contribute to estrogen signaling through the tethering pathway. In addition, we define a set of endogenous genes for which ERalpha tethering through activator protein 1 (e.g. c-Fos) and cAMP response element-binding protein family members mediates estrogen responsiveness. Finally, we show that functional interplay between c-Fos and cAMP response element-binding protein 1 contributes to estrogen-dependent regulation through the tethering pathway.

We have identified an essential yeast WD-repeat-containing protein, termed Rrb1p, that has a role in both the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunits and the transcriptional regulation of ribosomal protein (RP) genes. Rrb1p is located in the nucleus and is concentrated in the nucleolus. Its presence is required to maintain normal cellular levels of 60S subunits, 80S ribosomes, and polyribosomes. The function of Rrb1p in ribosome biogenesis appears to be linked to its association with the ribosomal protein rpL3. Immunoprecipitation of Rrb1p from nuclear extracts revealed that it physically interacts with rpL3. Moreover, the overproduction of Rrb1p led to increases in cellular levels of free rpL3 that accumulated in the nucleus together with Rrb1p. The concentration of these proteins within the nucleus was dependent on ongoing protein translation. We also showed that overexpression of RRB1 led to an increase in the expression of RPL3 while all other examined RP genes were unaffected. In contrast, depletion of RRB1 caused an increase in the expression of all RP genes examined except RPL3. These results suggest that Rrb1p regulates RPL3 expression and uncouples it from the coordinated expression of other RP genes.",2001-02,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,1260-71,,4,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Alleles; Amino Acid; Fungal; Fungal/genetics/metabolism; Fungal Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Gene Expression; Genes; Messenger/genetics/metabolism; Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Protein Biosynthesis; Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism; Repetitive Sequences; Ribosomal Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Ribosomes/*metabolism; RNA; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of a mild Cntnap2 mutation on body weight were highly dependent on genetic background, as both obesity-promoting and obesity-resistant effects of Cntnap2 were observed on different genetic backgrounds. The more severe effect of complete TAG1 deficiency, by decreasing food intake, completely prevented the weight gain normally associated with high-fat-diet feeding. Together, these studies implicate two novel proteins in the regulation of diet-induced obesity.

Our previous studies in HepG2 cells showed that, under these conditions, newly synthesized apoB remains stably associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Mitchell, D. M., Zhou, M., Pariyarath, R., Wang, H., Aitchison, J. D., Ginsberg, H. N., and Fisher, E. A. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 14733-14738). We now show that independent of lipid synthesis, apoB chains that appear full-length are, in fact, incompletely translated polypeptides still engaged by the ribosome and associated with the ER translocon. In the presence of active lipid synthesis and transfer, translation and lipoprotein assembly are completed, and the complexes exit the ER. Upon omitting fatty acids from, or adding a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor to, culture media to reduce lipid synthesis or transfer, respectively, apoB was degraded while it remained associated with the ER and complexed with cytosolic hsp70 and proteasomes. Thus, unlike other ER substrates of the proteasome, such as major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, apoB does not fully retrotranslocate to the cytosol before entering the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Although, upon immunofluorescence, apoB in proteasome-inhibited cells accumulated in punctate structures similar in appearance to aggresomes (cytosolic structures containing molecules irreversibly lost from the secretory pathway), these apoB molecules could be secreted when lipid synthesis was stimulated. The results suggest a model in which 1) apoB translation does not complete until lipoprotein assembly terminates, and 2) assembly with lipids or entry into the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway occurs while apoB polypeptides remain associated with the translocon and attached to the ribosome.",1/5/01,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,541-50,,1,276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Protein Biosynthesis; Antibodies; Apolipoproteins B/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/*metabolism; Biological; Cultured; Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism; Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism; Epitopes/immunology; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism; Humans; Kinetics; Lipoproteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism; Liver/metabolism; Macromolecular Substances; Membrane Proteins/metabolism; Models; Monoclonal/immunology; Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism; Precipitin Tests; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Protein Binding; Protein Transport; Ribosomes/*metabolism; Tumor Cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This binding of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 to a 120-spot dsDNA array made with alternating 200-microm spots of its dsDNA operator sequence and an unrelated DNA sequence proves that this method could be used to simultaneously monitor the kinetics of binding of proteins to 120 different dsDNA sequences with a sensitivity to approximately 0.5 pg (<2 x 10(7) molecules) of bound protein in each array spot at a time resolution of 1 s. The method is label free and also allows absolute quantitative determination of the binding stoichiometry (i.e., the number of proteins bound per dsDNA) at each time. The dsDNA array was fabricated using a robotic microspotting system to deliver nanoliter droplets of biotinylated dsDNA solutions onto a streptavidin linker layer immobilized with biotinylated alkylthiols on a thin gold film. Simultaneous monitoring of binding to the many array elements allows the use of reference spots (i.e., array elements with unrelated dsDNA sequences) to correct the signal for nonspecific protein-DNA binding and changes in bulk refractive index of the solutions in the SPR microscopeâ€°Ã›Âªs flow cell.

Protein glycosylation is prevalent in proteins destined for extracellular environments. These include proteins localized on the extracellular surface and those secreted to body fluids. In search of a method that has the potential to identify and quantify most proteins found in body fluids or the cell surface, we have recently developed a novel method for solid-phase extraction of formerly N-linked glycosylated peptides from glycoproteins. It has been shown that proteins secreted to body fluids or localized on the cell surface can be specifically enriched by this method. The technique is based on the conjugation of glycoproteins to a solid support using hydrazide chemistry, removal of nonglycosylated peptides by trypsin digestion, stable isotope labeling of glycopeptides, and the specific release of formerly N-linked glycosylated peptides via peptide-N-glycosidase.

S. pneumoniae has a large percentage of its genome devoted to sugar uptake and metabolism, and therefore, regulation of these processes is likely to be crucial for fitness in the nasopharynx and may play a role during invasive disease. In many bacteria, carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is central to such regulation, influencing hierarchical sugar utilization and growth rates. CcpA is the major transcriptional regulator in CCR in several gram-positive bacteria. We show that CcpA functions in CCR of lactose-inducible beta-galactosidase activity in S. pneumoniae. CCR of maltose-inducible alpha-glucosidase, raffinose-inducible alpha-galactosidase, and cellobiose-inducible beta-glucosidase is unaffected in the ccpA strain, suggesting that other regulators, possibly redundant with CcpA, control these systems. The ccpA strain is severely attenuated for nasopharyngeal colonization and lung infection in the mouse, establishing its role in fitness on these mucosal surfaces. Comparison of the cell wall fraction of the ccpA and wild-type strains shows that CcpA regulates many proteins in this compartment that are involved in central and intermediary metabolism, a subset of which are required for survival and multiplication in vivo. Both in vitro and in vivo defects were complemented by providing ccpA in trans. Our results demonstrate that CcpA, though not a global regulator of CCR in S. pneumoniae, is required for colonization of the nasopharynx and survival and multiplication in the lung.",2005-12,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,8340-9,,24,187,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Carbohydrate Metabolism; *Virulence Factors; alpha-Galactosidase/analysis; alpha-Glucosidases/analysis; Animals; Bacterial; Bacterial/analysis; Bacterial Proteins/analysis/genetics/*physiology; beta-Galactosidase/analysis; beta-Glucosidase/analysis; Carrier State/microbiology; Cell Wall/chemistry; Colony Count; DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology; Electrophoresis; Gel; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Complementation Test; Insertional; Lactose/metabolism; Messenger/analysis; Mice; Microbial; Mutagenesis; Nasopharynx/microbiology; Non-P.H.S.; Non-U.S. Govâ€°Ã›Âªt; Pneumococcal Infections/microbiology; Pneumococcal/microbiology; Pneumonia; Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology; Research Support; RNA; Streptococcus pneumoniae/genetics/*metabolism/*pathogenicity; Two-Dimensional; U.S. Govâ€°Ã›Âªt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both methods use streptavidin (SA) as a linker layer between a biotin-containing mixed self-assembled monolayer (SAM) and biotinylated dsDNAs to produce arrays with high packing density. The primary mixed SAM is produced from biotin- and oligo(ethylene glycol)-terminated thiols bonded as thiolates onto the gold surface. In the first method, a robotic microspotter is used to deliver nanoliter droplets of dsDNA solution onto a uniform layer of this SA ( approximately 2 x 10(12) SA/cm(2)). SPR microscopy shows a density of (5-6) x 10(11) dsDNA/cm(2) (0.2-0.3 dsDNA/SA) in the array elements. The second method uses instead a microspotted array of this SA linker layer, onto which the microspots of dsDNA are added with spatial registry. SPR microscopy before addition of the dsDNA shows a SA coverage of 2 x 10(12) SA/cm(2) within the spots and a dsDNA density of 8.5 +/- 3.5 x 10(11) dsDNA/cm(2) (0.3-0.7 dsDNA/SA, depending on the length of dsDNA) after dsDNA spotting.

Deletion of seven genes (CHL1, CSM3, BIM1, KAR3, TOF1, CTF4, and VIK1) resulted in defective sister chromatid cohesion. Mass spectrometric analysis of immunoprecipitated complexes identified a physical association between Kar3p and Vik1p and an interaction between Csm3p and Tof1p that we confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation from cell extracts.

Even though a large number of potential biomarkers have been proposed over the past few years, almost none of them have been so far implemented in the clinic. One of the reasons for this limited success is the lack of technologies to validate proposed biomarker candidates in larger patient cohorts. This limitation could be alleviated by the use of antibody-independent validation methods such as Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM). Similar to measurements based on affinity-reagents, SRM based targeted mass spectrometry also requires the generation of definitive assays for each targeted analyte. Here we present a library of SRM assays for 5568 N-glycosites enabling the multiplexed evaluation of clinically relevant N-glycoproteins as biomarker candidates. We demonstrate that this resource can be utilized to select SRM assay sets for cancers-associated N-glycoproteins for their subsequent multiplexed and consistent quantification in 120 human plasma samples.

The ensuing association/dissociation and catalytic activity of numerous trans-acting protein factors, RNAs and ribosomal proteins ultimately leads to the maturation of the precursor rRNAs into 25, 5.8 and 18 S rRNAs and the formation of mature cytoplasmic 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits.

It physically interacts with rRNA processing factors, notably Cbf5p and Nop2p, and co-fractionates specifically with pre-60 S particles on sucrose gradients. Deletion or mutations within NOP53 cause significant growth defects and display significant 60 S subunit deficiencies, an imbalance in the 40 S:60 S ratio, as revealed by polysome profiling, and defects in progression beyond the 27 S stage of 25 S rRNA maturation during 60 S biogenesis.",6/15/05,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,819-26,,Pt 3,388,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cell Nucleolus/chemistry/*metabolism; Fungal; Fungal/genetics/metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Polyribosomes/genetics/metabolism; Protein Subunits/chemistry/metabolism; Ribosomal/genetics/metabolism; Ribosomes/*chemistry/*metabolism; RNA; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/growth & development; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach recapitulated the assembly of the PP2A catalytic subunit into many different trimeric complexes but also revealed several new protein-protein interactions. Here we define a novel large multiprotein assembly, referred to as the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex.

Although the function of the CCM3 protein is unknown, the CCM3 gene is mutated in familial cerebral cavernous malformations, a condition associated with seizures and strokes. Our proteomics survey indicates that a large portion of the CCM3 protein resides within the STRIPAK complex, opening the way for further studies of CCM3 biology. The STRIPAK assembly establishes mutually exclusive interactions with either the CTTNBP2 proteins (which interact with the cytoskeletal protein cortactin) or a second subcomplex consisting of the sarcolemmal membrane-associated protein (SLMAP) and the related coiled-coil proteins suppressor of IKKepsilon (SIKE) and FGFR1OP2.

Additionally, Yta7 regulates histone gene transcription and has overlapping functions with known histone chaperones. This study focused on deciphering the functional role of the noncanonical Yta7 bromodomain. By use of genetic and epistasis analyses, the Yta7 bromodomain was shown to be necessary for barrier activity at HMR and to have overlapping functions with histone regulators (Asf1 and Spt16). Canonical bromodomains can bind to acetylated lysines on histones; however, the Yta7 bromodomain showed an association with histones that was independent of posttranslational modification. Further investigation showed that regions of Yta7 other than the bromodomain conferred histone association. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-chip analyses revealed that the Yta7 bromodomain was not solely responsible for histone association but was also necessary for proper chromosomal positioning of Yta7. This work demonstrates that the Yta7 bromodomain engages histones for certain cellular functions like barrier chromatin maintenance and particular Spt16/Asf1 cellular pathways of chromatin regulation.",2009-09,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,4604-11,,17,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Chromosome Positioning; Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism; Chromatin/*metabolism; Chromosomal Proteins; Epistasis; Fungal; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic; Histones/genetics/metabolism; Humans; Molecular Chaperones/metabolism; Non-Histone/*genetics/metabolism; Protein Structure; Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/*genetics/metabolism; Tertiary; Transcription; Transcriptional Elongation Factors/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although numerous human phosphorylation sites and their dynamics have been characterized, the evolutionary history and physiological importance of many signaling events remain unknown. Using target phosphoproteomes determined with a similar experimental and computational pipeline, we investigated the conservation of human phosphorylation events in distantly related model organisms (fly, worm, and yeast). With a sequence-alignment approach, we identified 479 phosphorylation events in 344 human proteins that appear to be positionally conserved over approximately 600 million years of evolution and hence are likely to be involved in fundamental cellular processes. This sequence-alignment analysis suggested that many phosphorylation sites evolve rapidly and therefore do not display strong evolutionary conservation in terms of sequence position in distantly related organisms. Thus, we devised a network-alignment approach to reconstruct conserved kinase-substrate networks, which identified 778 phosphorylation events in 698 human proteins. Both methods identified proteins tightly regulated by phosphorylation as well as signal integration hubs, and both types of phosphoproteins were enriched in proteins encoded by disease-associated genes. We analyzed the cellular functions and structural relationships for these conserved signaling events, noting the incomplete nature of current phosphoproteomes. Assessing phosphorylation conservation at both site and network levels proved useful for exploring both fast-evolving and ancient signaling events. We reveal that multiple complex diseases seem to converge within the conserved networks, suggesting that disease development might rely on common molecular networks.",2009,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,ra39,,81,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Binding Sites; Caenorhabditis elegans/genetics/metabolism; Cluster Analysis; Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/chemistry/genetics/metabolism; Disease Susceptibility/metabolism/*physiopathology; Drosophila melanogaster/genetics/metabolism; Evolution; Humans; Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Structure; Phosphoproteins/classification/*metabolism; Phosphorylation; Phylogeny; Proteins/classification/genetics/*metabolism; Protein Structure; Proteomics/methods; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/metabolism; Sequence Homology; Signal Transduction/*physiology; Tertiary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This 40-kDa protein shares approximately 65% amino acid identity with mammalian p38-alpha isoforms. Mipk was one of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in immature oocytes arrested at the G(2)/M transition of meiosis I. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Mipk was increased in response to anisomycin, heat, and osmotic shock of oocytes. During 1-methyladenine-induced oocyte maturation, Mipk underwent tyrosine dephosphorylation and remained dephosphorylated in mature oocytes and during the early mitotic cell divisions until approximately 12 h after fertilization. At the time of differentiation and acquisition of G phases in the developing embryos, Mipk was rephosphorylated on tyrosine. In oocytes that were microinjected with Mipk antisense oligonucleotides and subsequently were allowed to mature and become fertilized, differentiation was blocked. Because MipK antisense oligonucleotides and a dominant-negative (K62R)Mipk when microinjected into immature oocytes failed to induce germinal vesicle breakdown, inhibition of Mipk function was not sufficient by itself to cause oocyte maturation.

Specifically, we propose the usage of in silico mass tags, where the observed MS1-features are matched against de novo predicted masses and retention times for all peptides derived from a sequence database. We present a statistical model to assign protein-level probabilities based on the MS1-features and combine this data with the fragmentation spectra.

Major findings were that 1) CK2 phosphorylated the phospholipase on serines 93, 105, and 716; 2) ERK2 phosphorylated the enzyme on serine 730; 3) there was cross-antagonism between the reactions that phosphorylated serines 716 and 730; 4) PP2A selectively hydrolyzed phosphate groups that were esterified to serines 716 and 730; 5) CK2alpha formed a stable, MgATP/MgGTP-dependent complex with the phospholipase by a novel mechanism; and 6) the complex showed reduced phospholipase activity and resembled a complex identified in homogenates of macaque testis. These results provide the first available information about the effects of reactions of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on the behavior of the phospholipase, shed light on properties of CK2alpha that may be required for the formation of complexes with its substrates, and raise the possibility that a complex containing CK2alpha and the phospholipase may play a special biological role in the testis.",7/20/01,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,27698-708,,29,276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Casein Kinase II; Chromatography; Gel; Macaca; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphatidic Acids/*metabolism; Phospholipases A1; Phospholipases A/chemistry/*metabolism; Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism; Phosphorylation; Precipitin Tests; Protein Binding; Protein Phosphatase 2; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism; Testis/enzymology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interest in this modification is increasing as evidence accumulates that it is an abundant and transient modification that is dynamic and responsive to cellular stimuli. Concurrent advances in biological mass spectrometry (MS) have facilitated high-sensitivity protein identification by tandem MS. In this study, we show that the lability of the O-GlcNAc moiety to low-energy collision in tandem MS offers a means of distinguishing such peptides from others that are not modified. The differential between the energy required to remove the O-GlcNAc group and the energy required to fragment the peptide chain allows the O-GlcNAc group to be detected and the peptide sequence, and therefore the protein, to be identified. This technique thus allows the simultaneous detection and identification of O-GlcNAc-modified peptides, even when present at low levels in complex mixtures. The method was initially developed and validated using a synthetic O-GlcNAc-modified peptide and then applied to the detection of an extremely low abundance O-GlcNAc-modified peptide from bovine alpha-crystallin.

The results of in vitro GTPase single-turnover assays using Galpha(i) indicated that RGS18 accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Galpha(i).

Coordinated induction in transcriptional level of genes involved in protein biosynthesis is a distinctive feature of the transcriptome in hibernating black bears. This finding implies induction of translation and suggests an adaptive mechanism that contributes to a unique ability to reduce muscle atrophy over prolonged periods of immobility during hibernation.

For example, mouse splenic CD8alpha(+), but not CD8alpha(-) DCs selectively take up dying cells and cross-present cell-associated Ags to naive T cells. In this study, we identified genes that were more expressed in CD8alpha(+) than CD8alpha(-) DCs by microarray analysis. Only one of these genes, when the extracellular domains were linked to human IgG Fc domain, could bind to late apoptotic or necrotic cells. This gene was a new member of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (Trem) family, Trem-like 4 (Treml4).

Treml4, like other Trem family members, could associate with the adaptor molecule DNAX activation protein 12 kDa, but neither DNAX activation protein 10 kDa nor FcRgamma. Consistent with the microarray data, we confirmed that Treml4 protein was more expressed on CD8alpha(+) than CD8alpha(-) DCs, and we also found that Treml4 was expressed at high levels on splenic macrophages in spleen, particularly red pulp and marginal metallophilic macrophages. In addition, Treml4 expression on DCs was not changed after maturation induced by TLR ligands. Thus, Treml4 is a new Trem family molecule that is abundantly expressed on CD8alpha(+) DCs and subsets of splenic resident macrophages, and can recognize dead cells by different types of phagocytes in spleen.",2/1/09,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,1278-86,,3,182,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adaptor Proteins; Animals; Antigens; Biological Markers/metabolism; CD8/biosynthesis/metabolism; Cell Adhesion/immunology; Cell Death/immunology; Cell Line; Dendritic Cells/chemistry/cytology/*metabolism; Experimental; Humans; Immunologic/*metabolism; Inbred BALB C; Inbred C57BL; Macrophages/chemistry/cytology/*metabolism; Melanoma; Mice; Myeloid Cells/chemistry/cytology/*metabolism; Natural Killer Cell/metabolism; Phagocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism; Protein Binding/immunology; Receptors; Signal Transducing/*metabolism; Spleen/cytology/immunology/metabolism; Tumor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date sixteen FA genes have been identified, three of which predispose heterozygous mutation carriers to breast cancers. The FA proteins work together in a genome maintenance pathway, the so-called FA/BRCA pathway which is important during the S phase of the cell cycle. Since not all FA patients can be linked to (one of) the sixteen known complementation groups, new FA genes remain to be identified. In addition the complex FA network remains to be further unravelled. One of the FA genes, FANCI, has been identified via a combination of bioinformatic techniques exploiting FA protein properties and genetic linkage. The aim of this study was to develop a prioritization approach for proteins of the entire human proteome that potentially interact with the FA/BRCA pathway or are novel candidate FA genes. To this end, we combined the original bioinformatics approach based on the properties of the first thirteen FA proteins identified with publicly available tools for protein-protein interactions, literature mining (Nermal) and a protein function prediction tool (FuncNet). Importantly, the three newest FA proteins FANCO/RAD51C, FANCP/SLX4, and XRCC2 displayed scores in the range of the already known FA proteins. Likewise, a prime candidate FA gene based on next generation sequencing and having a very low score was subsequently disproven by functional studies for the FA phenotype. Furthermore, the approach strongly enriches for GO terms such as DNA repair, response to DNA damage stimulus, and cell cycle-regulated genes. Additionally, overlaying the top 150 with a haploinsufficiency probability score, renders the approach more tailored for identifying breast cancers related genes.

Cells overproducing Inp2p often transfer their entire populations of peroxisomes to buds. The levels of Inp2p oscillate with the cell cycle. Organelle-specific receptors like Inp2p explain how a single motor can move different organelles in distinct and specific patterns. To our knowledge, Inp2p is the first peroxisomal protein implicated in the vectorial movement of peroxisomes.",2006-05,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,587-600,,5,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Actomyosin/metabolism; Biological; Cell Cycle; Cell Surface/*metabolism; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression; Intracellular Membranes/*metabolism; Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism; Models; Molecular Motor Proteins/*metabolism; Myosin Heavy Chains/*metabolism; Myosin Type V/*metabolism; Organelles/metabolism; Peroxisomes/*metabolism; Protein Binding; Receptors; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/cytology/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These reagents contain an iodoacetyl group that selectively reacts with peptide cysteine residues. Peptide modification chemistry is also reported that allows tagging of peptides that are devoid of cysteine.

Amino-terminal acetylation of proteins is a common modification found throughout the tree of life: the N-terminus of a nascent polypeptide chain becomes co-translationally acetylated, often after the removal of the initiating methionine residue. While the enzymes and protein complexes involved in these processes have been extensively studied, only little is known about the biological function of such N-terminal modification events. To identify common principles of N-terminal acetylation, we analyzed the amino-terminal peptides from proteins extracted from Drosophila Kc167 cells. We detected more than 1,200 mature protein N-termini and could show that N-terminal acetylation occurs in insects with a similar frequency as in humans. As the sole true determinant for N-terminal acetylation we could extract the (X)PX rule that indicates the prevention of acetylation under all circumstances. We could show that this rule can be used to genetically engineer a protein to study the biological relevance of the presence or absence of an acetyl group, thereby generating a generic assay to probe the functional importance of N-terminal acetylation. We applied the assay by expressing mutated proteins as transgenes in cell lines and in flies. Here, we present a straightforward strategy to systematically study the functional relevance of N-terminal acetylations in cells and whole organisms. Since the (X)PX rule seems to be of general validity in lower as well as higher eukaryotes, we propose that it can be used to study the function of N-terminal acetylation in all species.",2009-11,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e1000236,,11,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Acetylation; Alanine/genetics/metabolism; Animals; Binding Sites/genetics; Blotting; Carboxy-Lyases/genetics/metabolism; Cell Line; Databases; Drosophila melanogaster/cytology/genetics/*metabolism; Drosophila Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Genetically Modified; Hela Cells; Humans; Immunoprecipitation; Mass Spectrometry; Mutation; Post-Translational/*physiology; Protein; Protein Biosynthesis; Protein Processing; Serine/genetics/metabolism; Threonine/genetics/metabolism; Transgenes/genetics; Western,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry is an attractive approach for studying protein-protein interactions and protein structure, but to date its use has been limited largely by low yields of informative cross-links (because of inefficient cross-linking reactions) and by the difficulty of confidently identifying the sequences of cross-linked peptide pairs from their fragmentation spectra. Here we present an approach based on a new MS labile cross-linking reagent, BDRG (biotin-aspartate-Rink-glycine), which addresses these issues. BDRG incorporates a biotin handle (for enrichment of cross-linked peptides prior to MS analysis), two pentafluorophenyl ester groups that react with peptide amines, and a labile Rink-based bond between the pentafluorophenyl groups that allows cross-linked peptides to be separated during MS and confidently identified by database searching of their fragmentation spectra. We developed a protocol for the identification of BDRG cross-linked peptides derived from purified or partially purified protein complexes, including software to aid in the identification of different classes of cross-linker-modified peptides. Importantly, our approach permits the use of high accuracy precursor mass measurements to verify the database search results. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by applying it to purified yeast TFIIE, a heterodimeric transcription factor complex, and to a single-step affinity-purified preparation of the 12-subunit RNA polymerase II complex. The results show that the method is effective at identifying cross-linked peptides derived from purified and partially purified protein complexes and provides complementary information to that from other structural approaches. As such, it is an attractive approach to study the topology of protein complexes.",2012-02,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,M111 008318,,2,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated that IGFBP2 expression is closely linked to genes in the integrin and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) pathways and that these genes are associated with prognosis. We further showed that IGFBP2 activates integrin beta1 and downstream invasion pathways, requires ILK to induce cell motility, and activates NF-kappaB.

In sterol-depleted cells, SCAP escorts SREBPs from ER to Golgi for proteolytic processing, thereby allowing SREBPs to stimulate cholesterol synthesis. Sterols induce binding of SCAP to INSIG-1, as determined by blue native-PAGE, and this is correlated with the inhibition of SCAP exit from the ER. Overexpression of INSIG-1 increases the sensitivity of cells to sterol-mediated inhibition of SREBP processing.

We previously have shown that these polymorphic genes, which primarily are expressed in the gut, exhibit characteristics of immune genes. In this report, we describe VCBP genomic organization and characterize adjacent and intervening genetic features which may influence both their polymorphism and complex transcriptional repertoire. RESULTS: VCBP genes 1, 2, 4, and 5 are encoded in a single contiguous gene-rich chromosomal region and VCBP3 is encoded in a separate locus. The VCBPs exhibit extensive haplotype variation, including copy number variation (CNV), indel polymorphism and a markedly elevated variation in repeat type and density. In at least one haplotype, inverted repeats occur more frequently than elsewhere in the genome. Multi-animal cDNA screening, as well as transcriptional profilingusing a novel transfection system, suggests that haplotype-specific transcriptional variants may contribute to VCBP genetic diversity. CONCLUSION: The availability of the Branchiostoma floridae genome (Joint Genome Institute, Brafl1), along with BAC and PAC screening and sequencing described here, reveal that the relatively limited number of VCBP genes present in the amphioxus genome exhibit exceptionally high haplotype variation. These VCBP haplotypes contribute a diverse pool of allelic variants, which includes gene copy number variation, pseudogenes, and other polymorphisms, while contributing secondary effects on gene transcription as well.",2008,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,78,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Genome; Animals; Artificial; Bacterial; Carrier Proteins/*genetics; Chitin/*metabolism; Chordata; Chromosomes; Gene Dosage; Genetic; Genetic Variation; Haplotypes; Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics; Models; Nonvertebrate/*genetics; Polymorphism; Transcription,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We constructed a glioma protein lysate array from 82 different primary glioma tissues, and surveyed the expression and phosphorylation of 46 different proteins involved in signaling pathways of cell proliferation, cell survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cell invasion. An analysis algorithm was employed to robustly estimate the protein expressions in these samples. When ranked by their discriminating power to separate 37 glioblastomas (high-grade gliomas) from 45 lower-grade gliomas, the following 12 proteins were identified as the most powerful discriminators: IBalpha, EGFRpTyr845, AKTpThr308, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), BadpSer136, insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) 2, IGFBP5, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB), Bcl-2, and c-Abl.

In metazoa, lamin proteins preserve nuclear integrity and higher order heterochromatin organization at the nuclear periphery, but no non-metazoan lamin orthologues have been identified, despite the likely presence of nucleoskeletal elements in many lineages. This suggests a metazoan-specific origin for lamins, and therefore that distinct protein elements must compose the nucleoskeleton in other lineages. The trypanosomatids are highly divergent organisms and possess well-documented but remarkably distinct mechanisms for control of gene expression, including polycistronic transcription and trans-splicing. NUP-1 is a large protein localizing to the nuclear periphery of Trypanosoma brucei and a candidate nucleoskeletal component. We sought to determine if NUP-1 mediates heterochromatin organization and gene regulation at the nuclear periphery by examining the influence of NUP-1 knockdown on morphology, chromatin positioning, and transcription. We demonstrate that NUP-1 is essential and part of a stable network at the inner face of the trypanosome nuclear envelope, since knockdown cells have abnormally shaped nuclei with compromised structural integrity. NUP-1 knockdown also disrupts organization of nuclear pore complexes and chromosomes. Most significantly, we find that NUP-1 is required to maintain the silenced state of developmentally regulated genes at the nuclear periphery; NUP-1 knockdown results in highly specific mis-regulation of telomere-proximal silenced variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) expression sites and procyclin loci, indicating a disruption to normal chromatin organization essential to life-cycle progression. Further, NUP-1 depletion leads to increased VSG switching and therefore appears to have a role in control of antigenic variation. Thus, analogous to vertebrate lamins, NUP-1 is a major component of the nucleoskeleton with key roles in organization of the nuclear periphery, heterochromatin, and epigenetic control of developmentally regulated loci.",2012-03,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e1001287,,3,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cysteine-containing peptides were detected within a mixture of peptides by incorporating chlorine into a general alkylating reagent specific for cysteine residues. Secondary search constraints included the specificity of the protease used for protein digestion and the molecular mass of the protein estimated by gel electrophoresis. The natural isotopic distribution of chlorine encoded the cysteine-containing peptide with a distinctive isotopic pattern that allowed automatic screening of mass spectra.

More than 60 components make up the budding yeast kinetochore, including inner kinetochore proteins that bind to centromeric chromatin and outer proteins that directly interact with microtubules. However, little is known about how these components assemble into a functional kinetochore and whether there are quality control mechanisms that monitor kinetochore integrity. We previously developed a method to isolate kinetochore particles via purification of the conserved Dsn1 kinetochore protein. We find that the Mub1/Ubr2 ubiquitin ligase complex associates with kinetochore particles through the CENP-C(Mif2) protein. Although Mub1/Ubr2 are not stable kinetochore components in vivo, they regulate the levels of the conserved outer kinetochore protein Dsn1 via ubiquitylation. Strikingly, a deletion of Mub1/Ubr2 restores the levels and viability of a mutant Dsn1 protein, reminiscent of quality control systems that target aberrant proteins for degradation. Consistent with this, Mub1/Ubr2 help to maintain viability when kinetochores are defective. Together, our data identify a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for the conserved Dsn1 kinetochore protein.

To characterize these PTPases, we purified enzyme activities directed against the phosphorylated T cell receptor zeta subunit by a combination of anion and cation chromatography procedures. A novel ELISA-based PTPase assay was developed to rapidly screen protein fractions for enzyme activity following the various chromatography steps.

Although the underlying mechanism has not been unraveled, an emerging body of evidence supports that H4 tail and its post-translational modification function as a recruitment motif for key factors required for proper regulation of chromatin transcription. To investigate these aspects, we have generated HeLa cell lines that constitutively express ectopic H4 tail domain for biochemical purification of proteins associated with H4 tail. We found that expressed H4 tails stably associate with sets of transcription regulatory factors and histone methyltransferases distinct from those that associate with histone H3 tails. Importantly, point mutations of four major lysine substrates to block cellular acetylation of ectopic H4 tail significantly inhibited the association of histone methyltransferases and sets of transcription-activating factors, supporting a major role of acetylation on recruitmentbased action of H4 tail during transcription. Further, our transcription analysis revealed that the proteins associated with wild-type/acetylated H4 tail, but not with mutant/unacetylated H4 tail, can enhance p300-dependent chromatin transcription. Taken together, these findings demonstrate novel roles for H4 tail and its acetylation in mediating recruitment of multiple regulatory factors that can change chromatin states for transcription regulation.",7/20/07,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,21024-31,,29,282,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Biological; Chromatin/chemistry; Genetic; Hela Cells; Histones/*chemistry; Humans; Lysine/chemistry; Mass Spectrometry; Models; Molecular Sequence Data; Plasmids/metabolism; Protein Binding; Protein Structure; Tertiary; Transcription,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although genes encoding PM proteins represent 20-30% of eukaryotic genomes, a detailed characterisation of their encoded proteins is underrepresented, due, to their low copy number and the inherent difficulties in their isolation and purification as a consequence of their high hydrophobicity. We describe here a strategy that combines two orthogonal methods to isolate and purify PM proteins from Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. In this two-step method, we first used cationic colloidal silica (CCS) to isolate adherent (Ad) and non-adherent (nAd) PM fractions, and then subjected each fraction to Triton X-114 (TX-114) phase partitioning to further enrich for hydrophobic proteins. While CCS alone identified 255/757 (34%) membrane proteins, CCS/TX-114 in combination yielded 453/745 (61%). Strikingly, of those proteins unique to CCS/TX-114, 277/393 (70%) had membrane annotation.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the dynamin-like protein Vps1p (vacuolar protein sorting protein 1) is involved in peroxisome fission, as cells deleted for the VPS1 gene contain reduced numbers of enlarged peroxisomes. What relationship Vps1p has with peroxisomes remains unclear. Here we show that Vps1p interacts with Pex19p, a peroxin that acts as a shuttling receptor for peroxisomal membrane proteins or as a chaperone assisting the assembly/stabilization of proteins at the peroxisome membrane. Vps1p contains two putative Pex19p recognition sequences at amino acids 509-523 and 633-647. Deletion of the first (but not the second) sequence results in reduced numbers of enlarged peroxisomes in cells, as in vps1delta cells. Deletion of either sequence has no effect on vacuolar morphology or vacuolar protein sorting, suggesting that the peroxisome and vacuole biogenic functions of Vps1p are separate and separable. Substitution of proline for valine at position 516 of Vps1p abrogates Pex19p binding and gives the peroxisome phenotype of vps1delta cells. Microscopic analysis showed that overexpression of Pex19p or redirection of Pex19p to the nucleus does not affect the normal cellular distribution of Vps1p in the cytosol and in punctate structures that are not peroxisomes, suggesting that Pex19p does not function in targeting Vps1p to peroxisomes. Subcellular fractionation showed that a fraction of Vps1p is associated with peroxisomes and that deletion or mutation of the first Pex19p recognition sequence abrogates this association. Our results are consistent with Pex19p acting as a chaperone to stabilize the association of Vps1p with peroxisomes and not as a receptor involved in targeting Vps1p to peroxisomes.",5/5/06,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,12817-23,,18,281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Genotype; GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology; Intracellular Membranes/metabolism; Membrane Proteins/metabolism/*physiology; Molecular Chaperones/chemistry; Molecular Sequence Data; Peroxisomes/metabolism; Phenotype; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/chemistry/metabolism/*physiology; Vacuoles/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the effects of oral administration of MBP on the cellular trafficking of the MBP-specific TCR-Tg cells and the ability of oral MBP to protect Tg mice from EAE. Tg mice were fed MBP, OVA or vehicle and sacrificed at various times after feeding. An immediate and dramatic decrease in Valpha2.3/Vbeta8.2(+)-Tg cells was observed in the periphery within 1 h after feeding. By 3 days after feeding, the percentage of Tg cells increased to near control levels, but decreased again by 10 days. When MBP or vehicle-fed Tg mice were challenged for EAE at this point, disease was severe in the vehicle-fed mice and reduced in the MBP-fed mice over the 40-day observation period. In vitro studies revealed a biphasic pattern of MBP proliferative unresponsiveness and an induction of Th1 cytokines. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the number of Tg cells found in the intestinal lamina propria increased dramatically as the number of Tg cells in the periphery decreased. There was no apparent proliferation of Tg cells in the lamina propria, indicating that Tg cells trafficked there from the periphery.

Its underlying molecular pathophysiology remains unclear, and no valid and objective diagnostic tools for the condition are available. METHODS: We performed large-scale proteomic profiling to identify novel peripheral biomarkers implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD in 25 drug-free female MDD patients and 25 healthy controls. First, quantitative serum proteome profiles were obtained and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using serum samples from 10 MDD patients and 10 healthy controls. Next, candidate biomarker sets, including differentially expressed proteins from the profiling experiment and those identified in the literature, were verified using multiple-reaction monitoring in 25 patients and 25 healthy controls. The final panel of potential biomarkers was selected using multiparametric statistical analysis. RESULTS: We identified a serum biomarker panel consisting of six proteins: apolipoprotein D, apolipoprotein B, vitamin D-binding protein, ceruloplasmin, hornerin, and profilin 1, which could be used to distinguish MDD patients from controls with 68% diagnostic accuracy. Our results suggest that modulation of the immune and inflammatory systems and lipid metabolism are involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of functional proteomic changes in the peripheral blood of patients with MDD further clarify the molecular biological pathway underlying depression. Further studies using larger, independent cohorts are needed to verify the role of these candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis of MDD.",4/19/16,5/6/16 19:11,5/9/16 20:41,,60-68,,,69,,Prog.

The method is based on the alternating acquisition of full mass spectra under different collision conditions inducing the cleavage of the substituents. Modified peptides are detected based on their specific fragmentation generating the nonmodified peptide backbone and reporter ions in the low mass region. The two mass analyzer stages of a Q-ToF instrument are used to eliminate the low mass chemical background in the quadrupole and thus facilitate the detection of low mass reporter ions in the ToF. Off-line data processing enables detection of one (or even multiple) modifications and the modified candidates are subsequently sequenced in a directed MS/MS mode.

However, new techniques for detailed genetic characterization and analysis of gene expression as well as protein modulation will become important in the further classification of AML subsets and the development of risk-adapted therapeutic strategies. In this context, we emphasize the importance of population-based clinical studies as a basis for future therapeutic guidelines. Such studies will then require the inclusion of patients at small clinical centers without specialized hematological research laboratories. To document a high and uniform quality of the laboratory investigations, it will be necessary to collect material for later analysis in selected laboratories.

However, the proteins associated with NDRG1 function are not fully enumerated. Using coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 58 proteins that interact with NDRG1 in prostate cancers cells. These proteins include nuclear proteins, adhesion molecules, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperons, proteasome subunits, and signaling proteins. Integration of our data with protein-protein interaction data from the Human Proteome Reference Database allowed us to build a comprehensive interactome map of NDRG1. This interactome map consists of several modules such as a nuclear module and a cell membrane module; these modules explain the reported versatile functions of NDRG1. We also determined that serine 330 and threonine 366 of NDRG1 were phosphorylated and demonstrated that the phosphorylation of NDRG1 was prominently mediated by protein kinase A (PKA). Further, we showed that NDRG1 directly binds to beta-catenin and E-cadherin. However, the phosphorylation of NDRG1 did not interrupt the binding of NDRG1 to E-cadherin and beta-catenin. Finally, we showed that the inhibition of NDRG1 expression by RNA interference decreased the ER inducible chaperon GRP94 expression, directly proving that NDRG1 is involved in the ER stress response. Intriguingly, we observed that many members of the NDRG1 interactome are androgen-regulated and that the NDRG1 interactome links to the androgen response network through common interactions with beta-catenin and heat shock protein 90. Therefore we overlaid the transcriptomic expression changes in the NDRG1 interactome in response to androgen treatment and built a dual dynamic picture of the NDRG1 interactome in response to androgen. This interactome map provides the first road map for understanding the functions of NDRG1 in cells and its roles in human diseases, such as prostate cancers, which can progress from androgen-dependent curable stages to androgen-independent incurable stages.",2007-04,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,575-88,,4,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Androgens/ metabolism/pharmacology; beta Catenin/metabolism; Biological; Cadherins/metabolism; Cell Cycle Proteins/chemistry/genetics/ metabolism; Cell Line; Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism; Hormone-Dependent/etiology/genetics/metabolism; Humans; Immunoprecipitation; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/chemistry/genetics/ metabolism; Male; Models; Neoplasms; Phosphorylation; Prostatic Neoplasms/etiology/genetics/ metabolism; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Mapping; Proteomics; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Tumor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an initial discovery phase N-linked glycoproteins with distinguishable expression patterns in primary normal and diseased tissue are detected and identified. In the second step the proteins identified in the initial phase are subjected to targeted MS analysis in plasma samples, using the highly sensitive and specific selected reaction monitoring (SRM) technology. Since glycosylated proteins, such as those secreted or shed from the cell surface are likely to reside and persist in blood, the two-stage strategy is focused on the quantification of tissue derived glycoproteins in plasma. The focus on the N-glycoproteome not only reduces the complexity of the analytes, but also targets an information-rich subproteome which is relevant for remote sensing of diseases in the plasma.

We identify up-regulated proteins in both serum and peritoneal fluid. To evaluate the overall performance of the approach we track the behavior of 20 validated markers across these experiments. METHODOLOGY: Mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics following extensive protein fractionation was used to compare serum of women with serous ovarian cancers to healthy women and women with benign ovarian tumors. Quantitation was achieved by isotopically labeling cysteine amino acids. Label-free mass spectrometry was used to compare peritoneal fluid taken from women with serous ovarian cancers and those with benign tumors. All data were integrated and annotated based on whether the proteins have been previously validated using antibody-based assays. FINDINGS: We selected 54 quantified serum proteins and 358 peritoneal fluid proteins whose case-control differences exceeded a predefined threshold. Seventeen proteins were quantified in both materials and 14 are extracellular. Of 19 validated markers that were identified all were found in cancers peritoneal fluid and a subset of 7 were quantified in serum, with one of these proteins, IGFBP1, newly validated here. CONCLUSION: Proteome profiling applied to symptomatic ovarian cancers cases identifies a large number of up-regulated serum proteins, many of which are or have been confirmed by immunoassays. The number of currently known validated markers is highest in peritoneal fluid, but they make up a higher percentage of the proteins observed in both serum and peritoneal fluid, suggesting that the 10 additional markers in this group may be high quality candidates.",2010,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e11137,,6,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) is an oligomeric transmembrane protein complex that is essential to T-cell recognition and function.

To increase proteome coverage, we explored new comprehensive public data sources for data likely to add new proteins to the Human PeptideAtlas. We then folded these data into a Human PeptideAtlas 2012 build and mapped it to Swiss-Prot, a protein sequence database curated to contain one entry per human protein coding gene. We find that this latest PeptideAtlas build includes at least one peptide for each of approximately 12500 Swiss-Prot entries, leaving approximately 7500 gene products yet to be confidently cataloged. We characterize these ""PA-unseen"" proteins in terms of tissue localization, transcript abundance, and Gene Ontology enrichment, and propose reasons for their absence from PeptideAtlas and strategies for detecting them in the future.",12/5/12,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein databases compiled from high quality empirical protein identifications that are in turn based on correct gene models increase the correctness, sensitivity, and quantitative accuracy of systems biology genome-scale experiments. RESULTS: In this manuscript, we present the Drosophila melanogaster PeptideAtlas, a fly proteomics and genomics resource of unsurpassed depth. Based on peptide mass spectrometry data collected in our laboratory the portal http://www.drosophila-peptideatlas.org allows querying fly protein data observed with respect to gene model confirmation and splice site verification as well as for the identification of proteotypic peptides suited for targeted proteomics studies. Additionally, the database provides consensus mass spectra for observed peptides along with qualitative and quantitative information about the number of observations of a particular peptide and the sample(s) in which it was observed. CONCLUSION: PeptideAtlas is an open access database for the Drosophila community that has several features and applications that support (1) reduction of the complexity inherently associated with performing targeted proteomic studies, (2) designing and accelerating shotgun proteomics experiments, (3) confirming or questioning gene models, and (4) adjusting gene models such that they are in line with observed Drosophila peptides.

Applying advanced computational methods developed for the analysis and integration of very large and diverse data sets generated by tandem MS measurements of tryptic peptides, we have now compiled a high-confidence human plasma proteome reference set with well over twice the identified proteins of previous high-confidence sets. It includes a hierarchy of protein identifications at different levels of redundancy following a clearly-defined scheme, which we propose as a standard that can be applied to any proteomics dataset to facilitate cross-proteome analyses. Further, to aid in development of blood-based diagnostics using techniques such as selected reaction monitoring (SRM), we provide a rough estimate of protein concentrations using spectral counting.

First, most methods for phosphopeptide enrichment lack the specificity to truly purify phosphopeptides. Second, fragmentation spectra of phosphopeptides, in particular those of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine containing peptides, are often dominated by the loss of the phosphate group(s) and therefore lack the information required to identify the peptide sequence and the site of phosphorylation, and third, sequence database search engines and statistical models for data validation are not optimized for the specific fragmentation properties of phosphorylated peptides. Consequently, phosphoproteomic data are characterized by large and unknown rates of false positive and false negative phosphorylation sites. Here we present an integrated chemical, mass spectrometric and computational strategy to improve the efficiency, specificity and confidence in the identification of phosphopeptides and their site(s) of phosphorylation. Phosphopeptides were isolated with high specificity through a simple derivatization procedure based on phosphoramidate chemistry. Identification of phosphopeptides, their site(s) of phosphorylation and the corresponding phosphoproteins was achieved by the optimization of the mass spectrometric data acquisition procedure, the computational tools for database searching and the data post processing.

In this review, we provide an overview of the general analysis approaches, software tools, and repositories that are enabling successful proteomics research via tandem mass spectrometry.",3/14/08,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,18-25,,1,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Software; Algorithms; Animals; Automatic Data Processing/*methods; Computational Biology/*methods; Database Management Systems; Databases; Humans; Protein; Proteome/analysis; Proteomics/*methods; Public Sector; Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods; Validation Studies as Topic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A format for the output of quantitative proteomics data, mzQuantML, and also TraML, for SRM/MRM transition lists, are both currently nearing completion. The corresponding MIAPE documents are being updated in line with advances in the field, as is the shared controlled vocabulary PSI-MS. In addition, the mzTab format was introduced, as a simpler way to report MS proteomics and metabolomics results.

These comparisons are usually performed on the level of protein lists generated from individual experiments. Unfortunately given the current technologies, these lists typically cover only a small fraction of the total protein content, making global comparisons extremely limited. Recently approaches have been suggested that are built on the comparison of computationally built feature lists instead of protein identifications. Although these approaches promise to capture a bigger spectrum of the proteins present in a complex mixture, their success is strongly dependent on the correctness of the identified features and the aligned retention times of these features across multiple experiments. In this experimental-computational study, we went one step further and performed the comparisons directly on the signal level. First signal maps were constructed that associate the experimental signals across multiple experiments. Then a feature detection algorithm used this integrated information to identify those features that are discriminating or common across multiple experiments. At the core of our approach is a score function that faithfully recognizes mass spectra from similar peptide mixtures and an algorithm that produces an optimal alignment (time warping) of the liquid chromatography experiments on the basis of raw MS signal, making minimal assumptions on the underlying data. We provide experimental evidence that suggests uniqueness and correctness of the resulting signal maps even on low accuracy mass spectrometers. These maps can be used for a variety of proteomic analyses. Here we illustrate the use of signal maps for the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers.

In this study, our goal was to identify molecular signatures, and potential key regulatory proteins, representative of the processes influencing early progression to fibrosis. We performed global protein profiling analyses on 24 liver biopsy specimens obtained from 15 HCV(+) liver transplant recipients at 6 and/or 12 months posttransplantation. Differentially regulated proteins associated with early progression to fibrosis were identified by analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Analysis of serum metabolites was performed on samples obtained from an independent cohort of 60 HCV(+) liver transplant patients. Computational modeling approaches were applied to identify potential key regulatory proteins of liver fibrogenesis. Among 4,324 proteins identified, 250 exhibited significant differential regulation in patients with rapidly progressive fibrosis. Patients with rapid fibrosis progression exhibited enrichment in differentially regulated proteins associated with various immune, hepatoprotective, and fibrogenic processes. The observed increase in proinflammatory activity and impairment in antioxidant defenses suggests that patients who develop significant liver injury experience elevated oxidative stresses. This was supported by an independent study demonstrating the altered abundance of oxidative stress-associated serum metabolites in patients who develop severe liver injury. Computational modeling approaches further highlight a potentially important link between HCV-associated oxidative stress and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms impacting on liver fibrogenesis. <b>CONCLUSION: </b>Our proteome and metabolome analyses provide new insights into the role for increased oxidative stress in the rapid fibrosis progression observed in HCV(+) liver transplant recipients.

Examples of such maps include libraries of the spectroscopic properties of molecules, or databases of drug structures in analytical or forensic chemistry. Such maps, and methods to navigate them, constitute reliable assays to probe any sample for the presence and amount of molecules contained in the map. So far, attempts to generate such maps for any proteome have failed to reach complete proteome coverage. Here we use a strategy based on high-throughput peptide synthesis and mass spectrometry to generate an almost complete reference map (97% of the genome-predicted proteins) of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. We generated two versions of this mass-spectrometric map, one supporting discovery-driven (shotgun) and the other supporting hypothesis-driven (targeted) proteomic measurements. Together, the two versions of the map constitute a complete set of proteomic assays to support most studies performed with contemporary proteomic technologies. To show the utility of the maps, we applied them to a protein quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, which requires precise measurement of the same set of peptides over a large number of samples. Protein measurements over 78 S. cerevisiae strains revealed a complex relationship between independent genetic loci, influencing the levels of related proteins.

The search engine implements the K-score algorithm, generating comparable output for the same input files as the original implementation.

Recent experimental protein interaction data provide us with an opportunity to examine whether we may explain, or even predict their interactions by computational sequence analysis. Such a question was recently posed by the use of random peptide screens to characterize the ligands of one such PRM, the SH3 domain. RESULTS: We describe a general computational procedure for identifying the ligand peptides of PRMs by combining protein sequence information and observed physical interactions into a simple probabilistic model and from it derive an interaction-mediated de novo motif-finding framework. Using a recent all-versus-all yeast two-hybrid SH3 domain interaction network, we demonstrate that our technique can be used to derive independent predictions of interactions mediated by SH3 domains. We show that only when sequence information is combined with such all versus all protein interaction datasets, are we capable of identifying motifs with sufficient sensitivity and specificity for predicting interactions. The algorithm is general so that it may be applied to other PRM domains (e.g. SH2, WW, PDZ).

Several different experimental and computational approaches were utilized to optimize the proteome coverage and to ensure statistically valid protein identification.

Sporozoites make their way through the skin and eventually to the liver, where they infect hepatocytes. Blocking this initial stage of infection is a promising malaria vaccine strategy. Therefore, comprehensively elucidating the protein composition of sporozoites will be invaluable in identifying targets for blocking malaria transmission. Previous efforts at identifying the proteins present in Plasmodium mosquito stages have been hampered by the technical difficulty of separating the parasite from its vector; without effective purifications, the large majority of proteins identified were of vector origin. Here we describe proteomic profiling of highly purified salivary gland sporozoites from two Plasmodium species: human-infective Plasmodium falciparum and rodent-infective Plasmodium yoelii. The combination of improved sample purification and high mass accuracy mass spectrometry has facilitated the most complete proteome coverage to date for a pre-erythrocytic stage of the parasite.

Furthermore, chemical labeling and identification of proteins exposed on the surface of live sporozoites revealed previously uncharacterized sporozoite surface proteome complexity.

These proteins are capable of assessing the behaviors of their cognate liver biological networks for toxicity or disease perturbations. Blood biomarkers are highly desirable diagnostics as blood is easily accessible and baths virtually all organs. Fifteen liver-specific blood proteins were identified as markers of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity using three proteomic technologies: label-free antibody microarrays, quantitative immunoblotting, and targeted iTRAQ mass spectrometry. Liver-specific blood proteins produced a toxicity signature of eleven elevated and four attenuated blood protein levels. These blood protein perturbations begin to provide a systems view of key mechanistic features of APAP-induced liver injury relating to glutathione and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) depletion, mitochondrial dysfunction, and liver responses to the stress. Two markers, elevated membrane-bound catechol-O-methyltransferase (MB-COMT) and attenuated retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), report hepatic injury significantly earlier than the current gold standard liver biomarker, alanine transaminase (ALT).

We have identified a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family which is highly induced in macrophages during bacillus Calmette-Guerin infection. Serpin 2a (spi2a) expression is also induced in macrophages in vivo during infection with Salmonella typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes, and in vitro by a variety of bacteria and bacterial products. The cytokine IFN-gamma also induces spi2a expression in macrophages, and this induction is synergistic with bacterial products. We also demonstrate here that a ubiquitin homolog, IFN-stimulated gene of 15-kDa (ISG15), is strongly induced during in vitro and in vivo activation of macrophages and that it conjugates to spi2a in activated macrophages. The ISG15-spi2a conjugates were identified by tandem mass spectrometry and contained spi2a conjugated to either one or two molecules of ISG15. Whereas spi2a was induced by either bacterial products or IFN-gamma, ISG15 was induced only by bacterial products. Although many protein targets have been described for ubiquitin conjugation, spi2a is the first ISG15-modified protein to be reported. Macrophage activation is accompanied by the activation of a variety of proteases. It is of interest that a member of the serine protease inhibitor family is concomitantly induced and modified by a ubiquitin-like protein.",3/1/02,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,2415-23,,5,168,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Transcriptional Activation; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Bacterial Infections/genetics/immunology; Bacterial/pharmacology; Cell Line; Cytokines/*metabolism; Inbred C57BL; Inbred ICR; Interferon-gamma/pharmacology; Macromolecular Substances; Macrophage Activation; Macrophages/drug effects/*immunology; Messenger/biosynthesis; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Polysaccharides; RNA; Serpins/*biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism; Ubiquitin/genetics; Ubiquitins; Up-Regulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development, one is interested in the â€°Ã›Âªrelative stabilitiesâ€°Ã›Âª of N attractors (N > 2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit part in the transition between two attractors in pair-attractor systems but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relates more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permits the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin-Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given, and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.",8/29/12,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Time- and space-resolved coupled metabolomic and taxonomic analyses demonstrate that the community-wide lipid accumulation phenotype is associated with the dominance of the generalist bacterium Candidatus Microthrix spp. By integrating population-level genomic reconstructions (reflecting fundamental niches) with transcriptomic and proteomic data (realised niches), we identify finely tuned gene expression governing resource usage by Candidatus Microthrix parvicella over time. Moreover, our results indicate that the fluctuating environmental conditions constrain the accumulation of genetic variation in Candidatus Microthrix parvicella likely due to fitness trade-offs.

Despite the bodyâ€°Ã›Âªs systemic responses to therapeutics, the liver is often the focus of damage and is usually the focus of studies of toxic effects due to its active roles in the metabolism of xenobiotics. It is extremely difficult, however, to assess systemic responses with currently available methods. Comprehensive cataloging of cell-free circulating RNAs using next-generation sequencing technology may open a window to assess drug-associated adverse effects at the systems level. To explore this potential, we conducted an RNA profiling study using the well-characterized acetaminophen overdose mouse model on liver and plasma with microarray and next-generation sequencing platforms, respectively. After drug treatment, the levels of a number of transcripts, both endogenous and exogenous RNAs, showed significant changes in plasma, reflecting not only the classical liver injury induced by acetaminophen overdose but also damage in tissues other than the liver. The changes in exogenous RNAs also reflect alteration on dieting behavior after acetaminophen overdose. Besides reporting an extensive list of circulating RNA-based biomarker candidates, this study illustrates the possibility of using circulating RNAs to assess global effects of therapeutics. This could also lead to a new approach for a more comprehensive assessment of the efficacy and safety of therapeutics.",2013-04,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,478-92,,2,132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is of great interest to understand their roles and a prerequisite for such study is the ability to comprehensively and accurately assess the levels of the entire repertoire of miRNAs in a given sample. It has been shown that some miRNAs frequently have sequence variations termed isomirs. To better understand the extent of miRNA sequence heterogeneity and its potential implications for miRNA function and measurement, we conducted a comprehensive survey of miRNA sequence variations from human and mouse samples using next generation sequencing platforms. Our results suggest that the process of generating this isomir spectrum might not be random and that heterogeneity at the ends of miRNA affects the consistency and accuracy of miRNA level measurement. In addition, we have constructed a database from our sequencing data that catalogs the entire repertoire of miRNA sequences (http://galas.systemsbiology.net/cgi-bin/isomir/find.pl). This enables users to determine the most abundant sequence and the degree of heterogeneity for each individual miRNA species. This information will be useful both to better understand the functions of isomirs and to improve probe or primer design for miRNA detection and measurement.",2010-11,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,2170-80,,11,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While evolving technologies for global profiling of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites are making it possible to comprehensively survey cellular physiology in newly sequenced organisms, these experimental techniques have not kept pace with sequencing efforts. Compounding these technological challenges is the fact that individual experiments typically only stimulate relatively small-scale cellular responses, thus requiring numerous expensive experiments to survey the operational relationships among nearly all genetic elements. Therefore, a relatively quick and inexpensive strategy for observing changes in large fractions of the genetic elements is highly desirable. RESULTS: We have discovered in the model organism Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 that batch culturing in complex medium stimulates meaningful changes in the expression of approximately two thirds of all genes. While the majority of these changes occur during transition from rapid exponential growth to the stationary phase, several transient physiological states were detected beyond what has been previously observed. In sum, integrated analysis of transcript and metabolite changes has helped uncover growth phase-associated physiologies, operational interrelationships among two thirds of all genes, specialized functions for gene family members, waves of transcription factor activities, and growth phase associated cell morphology control. CONCLUSIONS: Simple laboratory culturing in complex medium can be enormously informative regarding the activities of and interrelationships among a large fraction of all genes in an organism. This also yields important baseline physiological context for designing specific perturbation experiments at different phases of growth. The integration of such growth and perturbation studies with measurements of associated environmental factor changes is a practical and economical route for the elucidation of comprehensive systems-level models of biological systems.",2010,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,64,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Topoisomerases I and II are also targets for widely used antitumor agents. We demonstrated previously that in the human leukemia cell line, HL-60, resistance to topoisomerase (topo) II-targeting drugs such as etoposide is associated with site-specific hypophosphorylation of topo II alpha. This effect can be mimicked in sensitive cells treated with the intracellular Ca(2+) chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,Nâ€°Ã›Âª,Nâ€°Ã›Âª-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM). Here we identify Ser-1106 as a major phosphorylation site in the catalytic domain of topo II alpha. This site lies within the consensus sequence for the acidotrophic kinases, casein kinase I and casein kinase II. Mutation of serine 1106 to alanine (S1106A) abrogates phosphorylation of phosphopeptides that were found to be hypophosphorylated in resistant HL-60 cells or sensitive cells treated with BAPTA-AM. Purified topo II alpha containing a S1106A substitution is 4-fold less active than wild type topo II alpha in decatenating kinetoplast DNA and also exhibits a 2-4-fold decrease in the level of etoposide-stabilized DNA cleavable complex formation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (JN394t2-4) cells expressing S1106A mutant topo II alpha protein are more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of etoposide or amsacrine. These results demonstrate that Ca(2+)-regulated phosphorylation of Ser-1106 in the catalytic domain of topo II alpha modulates the enzymatic activity of this protein and sensitivity to topo II-targeting drugs.",4/11/03,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,12696-702,,15,278,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Serine; Alanine; Amino Acid Sequence; Antigens; Casein Kinase II; Casein Kinases; Catalytic Domain; Chelating Agents/pharmacology; Cloning; Consensus Sequence; DNA-Binding Proteins; DNA Primers; DNA Topoisomerases; Doxorubicin/toxicity; Egtazic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Eukaryotic/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism; HL-60 Cells; Humans; Kinetics; Mass; Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Molecular; Mutagenesis; Neoplasm; Peptide Fragments/chemistry; Phosphorylation; Phosphoserine/metabolism; Protein Kinases/chemistry; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry; Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/enzymology; Site-Directed; Spectrometry; Type II,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A larger sample has now been examined and the result is similar. The number of indels is approximately 1/12th of the number of base substitutions and the average length of the indels is 36 nt, including indels up to 10 kb. The ratio (R(u)) of unpaired nucleotides attributable to indels to those attributable to substitutions is 3.0 for this 2 million-nt chimp DNA sample compared with human. There is similar evidence of a large value of R(u) for sea urchins from the polymorphism of a sample of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus DNA (R(u) = 3-4). Other work indicates that similarly, per nucleotide affected, large differences are seen for indels in the DNA polymorphism of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (R(u) = 51). For the insect Drosophila melanogaster a high value of R(u) (4.5) has been determined. For the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans the polymorphism data are incomplete but high values of R(u) are likely. Comparison of two strains of Escherichia coli O157:H7 shows a preponderance of indels. Because these six examples are from very distant systematic groups the implication is that in general, for alignments of closely related DNA, indels are responsible for many more unmatched nucleotides than are base substitutions. Human genetic evidence suggests that indels are a major source of gene defects, indicating that indels are a significant source of evolutionary change.",4/15/03,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,4661-5,,8,100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Evolution; Animals; Artificial; Bacterial/genetics; Chromosomes; DNA; DNA/*genetics; Escherichia coli O157/genetics; Genetic; Humans; Molecular; Mutation; Nucleic Acid; Pan troglodytes/genetics; Polymorphism; Sea Urchins/genetics; Sequence Homology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate understanding of this medically important and architecturally interesting portion of the genome, we have sequenced and analyzed both the human and mouse class III regions. The cross-species comparison has facilitated the identification of 60 genes in human and 61 in mouse, including a potential RNA gene for which the introns are more conserved across species than the exons. Delineation of global organization, gene structure, alternative splice forms, protein similarities, and potential cis-regulatory elements leads to several conclusions: (1) The human MHC class III region is the most gene-dense region of the human genome: >14% of the sequence is coding, approximately 72% of the region is transcribed, and there is an average of 8.5 genes per 100 kb. (2) Gene sizes, number of exons, and intergenic distances are for the most part similar in both species, implying that interspersed repeats have had little impact in disrupting the tight organization of this densely packed set of genes. (3) The region contains a heterogeneous mixture of genes, only a few of which have a clearly defined and proven function. Although many of the genes are of ancient origin, some appear to exist only in mammals and fish, implying they might be specific to vertebrates. (4) Conserved noncoding sequences are found primarily in or near the 5â€°Ã›Âª-UTR or the first intron of genes, and seldom in the intergenic regions.

Specifically, using approximately 1500 publically available genome-wide transcriptome data sets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have reconstructed an environment and gene regulatory influence network that accurately predicts regulatory mechanisms and gene expression changes on exposure of cells to completely novel environments. Focusing on transcriptional networks that induce peroxisomes biogenesis, the model-guided experiments allow us to expand a core regulatory network to include novel transcriptional influences and linkage across signaling and transcription. Thus, the approach and model provides a multi-scalar picture of gene dynamics and are powerful resources for exploiting extant data to rationally guide experimentation.

RESULTS: In this study, we measured growth phenotypes of 465 Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion mutants under 16 metabolically relevant conditions and integrated them with the corresponding flux balance model predictions. We first used discordance between experimental results and model predictions to guide a stage of experimental refinement, which resulted in a significant improvement in the quality of the experimental data. Next, we used discordance still present in the refined experimental data to assess the reliability of yeast metabolism models under different conditions. In addition to estimating predictive capacity based on growth phenotypes, we sought to explain these discordances by examining predicted flux distributions visualized through a new, freely available platform. This analysis led to insight into the glycerol utilization pathway and the potential effects of metabolic shortcuts on model results. Finally, we used model predictions and experimental data to discriminate between alternative raffinose catabolism routes.

Both enzymatic activities are essential for transcription from a subset of genes and G(1) progression in mammalian cells. TAF7, another TFIID subunit, binds TAF1 and inhibits TAF1 HAT activity. Here we present data demonstrating that disruption of the TAF1/TAF7 interaction within TFIID by protein phosphorylation leads to activation of TAF1 HAT activity and stimulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin A gene transcription. Overexpression and small interfering RNA knockdown experiments confirmed that TAF7 functions as a transcriptional repressor at these promoters. Release of TAF7 from TFIID by TAF1 phosphorylation of TAF7 increased TAF1 HAT activity and elevated histone H3 acetylation levels at the cyclin D1 and cyclin A promoters. Serine-264 of TAF7 was identified as a substrate for TAF1 kinase activity. Using TAF7 S264A and S264D phosphomutants, we determined that the phosphorylation state of TAF7 at S264 influences the levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin A gene transcription and promoter histone H3 acetylation.

B.",Collision Energy Optimization of b- and y-Ions for Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry,Journal of Proteome Research,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr1004289,,"Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) is a highly sensitive and increasingly popular method of targeted mass spectrometry (MS) that can be used to selectively detect and quantify peptides and their corresponding proteins of interest within biological samples. The sensitivity of MRM-MS is highly dependent upon the tuning of transition-specific parameters, especially the collision energy (CE) applied during peptide fragmentation. Currently, empirical equations for CE work best for y-type ions and are much less effective for other types of transitions, such as b-type ions and small y-type transitions across particular amide bonds, which could also be useful for MRM-MS if optimized for maximum signal transmission. In this work, we have performed a CE optimization of all transitions for 80 doubly charged peptides, the results of which were used to define separate CE equations for b-ions and y-ions, as well as for small y-type ions derived from the fragmentation of amide bonds bounded on the amino-terminal side by aspartic or glutamic acid residues (D/E-X transitions). This analysis yielded four major observations: (1) b-ions tend to require lower collision energies than y-ions for optimal fragmentation, while D/E-X transitions tend to require more; (2) CE equations predict the optimal CEs more closely when product ion m/z dependence is included, in addition to the current standard of precursor ion m/z dependence; (3) separate CE equations for y-ions, b-ions, and D/E-X transitions are more effective than the previous one-size-fits-all equations, but best results are achieved by optimizing transitions individually; and (4) while b-ions gain substantial signal from CE optimization-often increases of several-fold-they still tend to rank lower than y-ions from the same peptide. These results confirm the notion that y-ions are usually the first-choice transitions for MRM experiments but also demonstrate, for the first time, that b-ions can be viable targets as well, if the proper collision energies are used.",11/22/10,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study tested the hypothesis that murine HSC can contribute to the regeneration of renal tubular epithelial cells after I/R injury. HSC isolated from male Rosa26 mice that express beta-galactosidase constitutively were transplanted into female nontransgenic mice after unilateral renal I/R injury. Four weeks after HSC transplantation, beta-galactosidase-positive cells were detected in renal tubules of the recipients by X-Gal staining. PCR analysis of the male-specific Sry gene and Y chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of male-derived cells in the kidneys of female recipients. Antibody co-staining showed that beta-galactosidase was primarily expressed in renal proximal tubules.

Constraint-based modeling is an approach to interrogate capabilities of reconstructed networks by constraining possible cellular behavior through the imposition of physicochemical laws. As a result, a steady-state flux space is defined that contains all possible functional states of the network. Uniform random sampling of the steady-state flux space allows for the unbiased appraisal of its contents. Monte Carlo sampling of the steady-state flux space of the reconstructed human red blood cell metabolic network under simulated physiologic conditions yielded the following key results: 1), probability distributions for the values of individual metabolic fluxes showed a wide variety of shapes that could not have been inferred without computation; 2), pairwise correlation coefficients were calculated between all fluxes, determining the level of independence between the measurement of any two fluxes, and identifying highly correlated reaction sets; and 3), the network-wide effects of the change in one (or a few) variables (i.e., a simulated enzymopathy or fixing a flux range based on measurements) were computed. Mathematical models provide the most compact and informative representation of a hypothesis of how a cell works. Thus, understanding model predictions clearly is vital to driving forward the iterative model-building procedure that is at the heart of systems biology.

Importantly, TLR3-LXR signal crosstalk promotes recruitment of NCOA5 to the Abca1 promoter together with loss of RNA polymerase II and reduced cholesterol efflux. Together, these data significantly expand our knowledge of regulatory inputs impinging on the Abca1 promoter and indicate a central role for NCOA5 in mediating crosstalk between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways that results in repression of macrophage cholesterol efflux.",5/5/15,2/5/16 22:14,2/9/16 0:19,,1244-1258,,9,34,,EMBO J.,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 25755249 PMCID: PMC4426483,,,,,"Animals; atherosclerosis; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1; Cholesterol; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Inflammation; LXR; Macrophages; mass spectrometry; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; NCOA5; Nuclear Receptor Coactivators; Orphan Nuclear Receptors; Promoter Regions, Genetic; quantitative mass spectrometry; RNA Polymerase II; Signal Transduction; Toll-Like Receptor 3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequence analysis shows that the proximal and distal regions of 15q share extensive ancient similarity. Using a simple approach, we have been able to reconstruct many of the events by which the current duplication structure arose.

The limited scan speed of current mass spectrometers along with the highly redundant selection of the most intense precursor ions generates a bias in the pool of identified proteins toward those of higher abundance. A directed LC-MS/MS approach that alleviates the limitations of DDA precursor ion selection by decoupling peak detection and sequencing of selected precursor ions is presented. In the first stage of the strategy, all detectable peptide ion signals are extracted from high resolution LC-MS feature maps or aligned sets of feature maps. The selected features or a subset thereof are subsequently sequenced in sequential, non-redundant directed LC-MS/MS experiments, and the MS/MS data are mapped back to the original LC-MS feature map in a fully automated manner. The strategy, implemented on an LTQ-FT MS platform, allowed the specific sequencing of 2,000 features per analysis and enabled the identification of more than 1,600 phosphorylation sites using a single reversed phase separation dimension without the need for time-consuming prefractionation steps. Compared with conventional DDA LC-MS/MS experiments, a substantially higher number of peptides could be identified from a sample, and this increase was more pronounced for low intensity precursor ions.",2008-11,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,2138-50,,11,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Cell Line; Chromatography; Databases; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins/isolation & purification; High Pressure Liquid/methods; Peptides/*isolation & purification; Phosphopeptides/isolation & purification; Protein; Proteomics/*methods/statistics & numerical data; Reproducibility of Results; Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), the innate immune receptor for bacterial flagellin, maps to chromosome 1q41 and contains a common stop codon polymorphism that abrogates signaling (allele C1174T) and is associated with an increased risk of infection. By using transmission disequilibrium testing in a cohort containing 199 affected patients and their 75 unaffected siblings and 326 parents, we found that allele 1174C, but not 1174T (with the stop codon), was preferentially transmitted to SLE-affected offspring (a 19:6 transmitted/not transmitted ratio, P = 0.009). In contrast, the alleles of the other three TLR5 SNPs did not exhibit preferential transmission. In addition, we found that allele 1174C was not preferentially transmitted to unaffected offspring (3:6 transmitted/not transmitted ratio, P value not significant). The allele frequency of 1174T in the probands was 3.2% compared with 5.8% in unaffected individuals, which was consistent with a protective association (odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.98; P = 0.041). Subjects with the TLR5 stop codon produced significantly lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in comparison with individuals with the wild-type genotype. Together, these results indicate that the TLR5 stop codon polymorphism is associated with protection from the development of SLE. These data support a role for flagellated bacteria and the innate immune response in the development of SLE with implications for novel immunomodulatory treatment strategies.",7/26/05,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,10593-7,,30,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Polymorphism; Chromosomes; Codon; Cohort Studies; Cytokines/metabolism; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics; Genotype; Human; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus; Pair 1/*genetics; Single Nucleotide; Systemic/*genetics/immunology; Terminator/*genetics; Toll-Like Receptor 5/*genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly, we analyse the approaches for reconstructing the emergent properties of physical or biological systems. We propose approaches to scale emergence according to the degree of state-dependency of the system's component properties. Since the component properties of biological systems are state-dependent to a high extent, biological emergence should be considered as very strong emergence - i.e. its reconstruction would require a lot of information about state-dependency of its component properties. However, due to its complexity and volume, this information cannot be handled in the naked human brain, or on the back of an envelope. To solve this problem, biological emergence can be reconstructed in silico based on experimentally determined rate laws and parameter values of the living cell. According to some rough calculations, the silicon human might comprise the mathematical descriptions of around 10(5) interactions. This is not a small number, but taking into account the exponentially increase of computational power, it should not prove to be our principal limitation. The bigger challenges will be located in different areas. For example they may be related to the observer effect - the limitation to measuring a system's component properties without affecting the system. Another obstacle may be hidden in the tradition of ""shaving away"" all ""unnecessary"" assumptions (the so-called Occam's razor) that, in fact, reflects the intention to model the system as simply as possible and thus to deem the emergence to be less strong than it possibly is. We argue here that that Occam's razor should be replaced with the law of completeness.",2013-04,2/8/16 23:58,2/9/16 0:19,,,,3-Feb,111,,Prog Biophys Mol Biol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These microarray expression profiles are available freely from our project web site http://www.innateImmunity-systemsbiology.org. Here, we report the development of a database of computationally predicted transcription factor binding sites and related genomic features for a set of over 2000 murine immune genes of interest. Our database, which includes microarray co-expression clusters and a host of web-based query, analysis and visualization facilities, is available freely via the internet. It provides a broad resource to the research community, and a stepping stone towards the delineation of the network of transcriptional regulatory interactions underlying the integrated response of macrophages to pathogens. DESCRIPTION: We constructed a database indexed on genes and annotations of the immediate surrounding genomic regions. To facilitate both gene-specific and systems biology oriented research, our database provides the means to analyze individual genes or an entire genomic locus. Although our focus to-date has been on mammalian toll-like receptor signaling pathways, our database structure is not limited to this subject, and is intended to be broadly applicable to immunology. By focusing on selected immune-active genes, we were able to perform computationally intensive expression and sequence analyses that would currently be prohibitive if applied to the entire genome. Using six complementary computational algorithms and methodologies, we identified transcription factor binding sites based on the Position Weight Matrices available in TRANSFAC. For one example transcription factor (ATF3) for which experimental data is available, over 50% of our predicted binding sites coincide with genome-wide chromatin immnuopreciptation (ChIP-chip) results. Our database can be interrogated via a web interface. Genomic annotations and binding site predictions can be automatically viewed with a customized version of the Argo genome browser. CONCLUSION: We present the Innate Immune Database (IIDB) as a community resource for immunologists interested in gene regulatory systems underlying innate responses to pathogens.

Global chromatin changes accompany the transition from proliferating NSCs to committed neuronal lineages, but the mechanisms involved have been unclear. Using a proteomics approach, we show that a switch in subunit composition of neural, ATP-dependent SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeling complexes accompanies this developmental transition. Proliferating neural stem and progenitor cells express complexes in which BAF45a, a Kruppel/PHD domain protein and the actin-related protein BAF53a are quantitatively associated with the SWI2/SNF2-like ATPases, Brg and Brm. As neural progenitors exit the cell cycle, these subunits are replaced by the homologous BAF45b, BAF45c, and BAF53b. BAF45a/53a subunits are necessary and sufficient for neural progenitor proliferation. Preventing the subunit switch impairs neuronal differentiation, indicating that this molecular event is essential for the transition from neural stem/progenitors to postmitotic neurons. More broadly, these studies suggest that SWI/SNF-like complexes in vertebrates achieve biological specificity by combinatorial assembly of their subunits.",7/19/07,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,201-15,,2,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Cell Differentiation/genetics/*physiology; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/genetics/*physiology; Developmental/genetics/physiology; Epigenesis; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic/genetics/physiology; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Multienzyme Complexes/genetics/*metabolism; Multipotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism; Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism; Neuroepithelial Cells/cytology/metabolism; Neuroglia/cytology/metabolism; Neurons/*cytology/metabolism; Protein Subunits/genetics/metabolism; Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This control is mediated, in part, by cytokines that are secreted by macrophages. Immune regulation is extraordinarily complex, and can be best investigated with systems approaches (that is, using computational tools to predict regulatory networks arising from global, high-throughput data sets). Here we use cluster analysis of a comprehensive set of transcriptomic data derived from Toll-like receptor (TLR)-activated macrophages to identify a prominent group of genes that appear to be regulated by activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a member of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. Network analysis predicted that ATF3 is part of a transcriptional complex that also contains members of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB family of transcription factors. Promoter analysis of the putative ATF3-regulated gene cluster demonstrated an over-representation of closely apposed ATF3 and NF-kappaB binding sites, which was verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation and hybridization to a DNA microarray. This cluster included important cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12b. ATF3 and Rel (a component of NF-kappaB) were shown to bind to the regulatory regions of these genes upon macrophage activation. A kinetic model of Il6 and Il12b messenger RNA expression as a function of ATF3 and NF-kappaB promoter binding predicted that ATF3 is a negative regulator of Il6 and Il12b transcription, and this hypothesis was validated using Atf3-null mice. ATF3 seems to inhibit Il6 and Il12b transcription by altering chromatin structure, thereby restricting access to transcription factors. Because ATF3 is itself induced by lipopolysaccharide, it seems to regulate TLR-stimulated inflammatory responses as part of a negative-feedback loop.",5/11/06,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,173-8,,7090,441,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Gene Expression Profiling; *Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects; *Systems Biology; Activating Transcription Factor 3/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism; Animals; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Cluster Analysis; Genetic/drug effects/genetics; Inbred C57BL; Kinetics; Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology; Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/immunology/metabolism; Mice; NF-kappa B/metabolism; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Response Elements/genetics; Toll-Like Receptor 4/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Transcription,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that LY83583, a generator of O-(2), activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) with early (10 min) and late (2 h) peaks and stimulated VSMC growth. To investigate whether secreted oxidative stress-induced factors (termed SOXF) from VSMC were responsible for late ERK1/2 activation in response to LY83583, we purified putative SOXF proteins from conditioned medium (2 h of LY83583 exposure) by sequential chromatography based on activation of ERK1/2. Proteins identified by capillary chromatography, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, and data base searching included heat shock protein 90-alpha (HSP90-alpha) and cyclophilin B. Western blot analysis of conditioned medium showed specific secretion of HSP90-alpha but not HSP90-beta. Immunodepletion of HSP90-alpha from conditioned medium significantly inhibited conditioned medium-induced ERK1/2 activation. Human recombinant HSP90-alpha reproduced the effect of conditioned medium on ERK1/2 activation.

This approach provides a biochemically and genetically consistent framework for the generation of hypotheses and the testing of functions of microbial cells.",2004,2/8/16 23:45,2/9/16 19:35,,886-897,,11,2,,Nat Rev Microbiol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,"*Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; *Genome, Bacterial; *Models, Biological; Computational Biology; Mathematics; Phenotype; Software; Systems Theory",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maintaining tetrad information allows accurate inference of missing genetic markers and full genotypes of missing (and presumably nonviable) individuals.

By altering the expression of a single nucleoporin gene, NUP53, we showed that the overproduction of Nup53p altered nuclear transport and had a profound effect on the structure of the nuclear membrane. Strikingly, conventional and immunoelectron microscopy analysis revealed that excess Nup53p entered the nucleus and associated with the nuclear membrane. Here, Nup53p induced the formation of intranuclear, tubular membranes that later formed flattened, double membrane lamellae structurally similar to the nuclear envelope. Like the nuclear envelope, the intranuclear double membrane lamellae enclosed a defined cisterna that was interrupted by pores but, unlike the nuclear envelope pores, they lacked NPCs. Consistent with this observation, we detected only two NPC proteins, the pore membrane proteins Pom152p and Ndc1p, in association with these membrane structures. Thus, these pores likely represent an intermediate in NPC assembly. We also demonstrated that the targeting of excess Nup53p to the NPC and its specific association with intranuclear membranes were dependent on the karyopherin Kap121p and the nucleoporin Nup170p. At the nuclear envelope, the abilities of Nup53p to associate with the membrane and drive membrane proliferation were dependent on a COOH-terminal segment containing a potential amphipathic alpha-helix. The implications of these results with regards to the biogenesis of the nuclear envelope are discussed.",5/14/01,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,709-24,,4,153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Membrane Transport Proteins; *Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins; *Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Active Transport; Cell Nucleus/*physiology; Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism; Electron; Fungal/physiology; Fungal Proteins/metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism; Membrane Proteins/metabolism; Microscopy; Nuclear Envelope/*metabolism/ultrastructure; Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism; Plasmids; Porins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism; Protein Structure; Receptors; Secondary; Tertiary; Yeasts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies of human genetic diseases on a large scale have provided many novel insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. However, most successful analyses ignored the mode of inheritance of diseases, which severely limits our understanding of human disease mechanisms relating to the mode of inheritance at the large scale. Therefore, we here conducted a systematic large-scale study of the inheritance mode of Mendelian disorders, to bring new insight into human diseases. Our analyses include the comparison between dominant and recessive disease genes on both genomic and proteomic characteristics, Mendelian mutations, protein network properties and disease connections on both the genetic and the population levels. We found that dominant disease genes are more functionally central, topological central and more sensitive to disease outcome. On the basis of these findings, we suggested that dominant diseases should have higher genetic heterogeneity and should have more comprehensive connections with each other compared with recessive diseases, a prediction we confirm by disease network and disease comorbidity.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 22 January 2014; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2013.309.",1/22/14,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the innate immune system context, epigenetic studies strongly implicate HAc in the transcriptional response of activated macrophages. We hypothesized that using data from large-scale sequencing of a HAc chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP-Seq) would improve the performance of computational prediction of binding locations of TFs mediating the response to a signaling event, namely, macrophage activation. RESULTS: We tested this hypothesis using a multi-evidence approach for predicting binding sites. As a training/test dataset, we used ChIP-Seq-derived TF binding site locations for five TFs in activated murine macrophages. Our model combined TF binding site motif scanning with evidence from sequence-based sources and from HAc ChIP-Seq data, using a weighted sum of thresholded scores. We find that using HAc data significantly improves the performance of motif-based TF binding site prediction. Furthermore, we find that within regions of high HAc, local minima of the HAc ChIP-Seq signal are particularly strongly correlated with TF binding locations. Our model, using motif scanning and HAc local minima, improves the sensitivity for TF binding site prediction by approximately 50% over a model based on motif scanning alone, at a false positive rate cutoff of 0.01.

However, with data from a relatively small number of individuals, it is difficult to distinguish true causal polymorphisms from the large number of possibilities. The problem is particularly challenging in populations with significant linkage disequilibrium, where traits are often linked to large chromosomal regions containing many genes. Here, we present a novel method, Lirnet, that automatically learns a regulatory potential for each sequence polymorphism, estimating how likely it is to have a significant effect on gene expression. This regulatory potential is defined in terms of ""regulatory features""-including the function of the gene and the conservation, type, and position of genetic polymorphisms-that are available for any organism. The extent to which the different features influence the regulatory potential is learned automatically, making Lirnet readily applicable to different datasets, organisms, and feature sets. We apply Lirnet both to the human HapMap eQTL dataset and to a yeast eQTL dataset and provide statistical and biological results demonstrating that Lirnet produces significantly better regulatory programs than other recent approaches. We demonstrate in the yeast data that Lirnet can correctly suggest a specific causal sequence variation within a large, linked chromosomal region. In one example, Lirnet uncovered a novel, experimentally validated connection between Puf3-a sequence-specific RNA binding protein-and P-bodies-cytoplasmic structures that regulate translation and RNA stability-as well as the particular causative polymorphism, a SNP in Mkt1, that induces the variation in the pathway.",2009-01,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,e1000358,,1,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Gene Regulatory Networks; *Quantitative Trait Loci; *Software; Algorithms; Computational Biology/*methods; Databases; Humans; Nucleic Acid; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Polymorphism; Single Nucleotide; Yeasts/genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A light- and redox-sensing transcription regulator, Bat, regulates critical genes encoding the biogenesis of the purple membrane.

In phototrophy, the second major biomodule for ATP production, arginine fermentation, is repressed.

We show here that during differentiation, cAMP agonists can cause a large increase in the mRNA and protein levels of several of the pro-inflammatory CXCL and CCL chemokines. The cAMP mediator-exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac) contributes substantially to the increase in these chemokines. These chemokines are known to play an important role in the regulation of immune responses, particularly regarding the pathogenesis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.

Macrophages respond to Salmonella typhimurium infection by activating caspase 1 through the NLR Ipaf. This activation is mediated by cytosolic flagellin through the activity of the virulence-associated type III secretion system (T3SS). We demonstrate here that Pseudomonas aeruginosa activates caspase 1 and induces IL-1beta secretion in infected macrophages. While live, virulent P. aeruginosa activate IL-1beta secretion through caspase 1 and Ipaf, strains that have mutations in the T3SS or in flagellin did not. Ipaf-dependent caspase 1 activation could be recapitulated by delivering P. aeruginosa flagellin to the macrophage cytosol. We examined the role of Naip5 in P. aeruginosa-induced caspase 1 activation by using A/J (Naip5-deficient) compared with C57BL/6 and BALB/c (Naip5-sufficient) macrophages and observed that A/J macrophages secrete IL-1beta in response to P. aeruginosa, S. typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes infection, as well as in response to cytosolic flagellin, but at slightly reduced levels. Thus, Ipaf-dependent detection of cytosolic flagellin is a conserved mechanism by which macrophages detect the presence of pathogens that use T3SS.",2/19/08,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,2562-7,,7,105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism; Calcium-Binding Proteins/*metabolism; Caspase 1/*metabolism; Cells; Cultured; Cytosol/metabolism; Enzyme Activation; Flagellin/pharmacology; Interleukin-1beta/secretion; Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism/secretion; Neuronal Apoptosis-Inhibitory Protein/metabolism; Protein Transport; Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which retinal is synthesized and bound to bacterioopsin in vivo is unknown. As a step toward identifying cellular factors involved in this process, we constructed an in-frame deletion of brp, a gene implicated in bacteriorhodopsin biogenesis. In the Deltabrp strain, bacteriorhodopsin levels are decreased approximately 4.0-fold compared with wild type, whereas bacterioopsin levels are normal. The probable precursor of retinal, beta-carotene, is increased approximately 3.8-fold, whereas retinal is decreased by approximately 3.7-fold. These results suggest that brp is involved in retinal synthesis. Additional cellular factors may substitute for brp function in the Deltabrp strain because retinal production is not abolished. The in-frame deletion of blh, a brp paralog identified by analysis of the Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 genome, reduced bacteriorhodopsin accumulation on solid medium but not in liquid. However, deletion of both brp and blh abolished bacteriorhodopsin and retinal production in liquid medium, again without affecting bacterioopsin accumulation. The level of beta-carotene increased approximately 5.3-fold. The simplest interpretation of these results is that brp and blh encode similar proteins that catalyze or regulate the conversion of beta-carotene to retinal.",2/23/01,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,5739-44,,8,276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bacterial; Bacteriorhodopsins/ biosynthesis; beta Carotene/metabolism; Gene Deletion; Genes; Halobacterium salinarum/ genetics; Insertional; Mutagenesis; Retinaldehyde/ biosynthesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This function is thought to involve the complex N-terminal domain. The goal of this current study was to examine its structural organization to further elucidate the regulatory mechanism. The amino-propeptide (alpha1-Npp) alone or with isoforms of the variable region were recombinantly expressed and purified by affinity and molecular sieve chromatography. Cys-1-Cys-4 and Cys-2-Cys-3 disulfide bonds were detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. This pattern is identical to the homologous alpha2-Npp, indicating that the recombinant proteins were folded correctly. Anomalous elution on molecular sieve chromatography suggested that the variable region was extended, which was confirmed using rotary shadowing; the alpha1-Npp formed a globular ""head"" and the variable region an extended ""tail."" Circular dichroism spectra analysis determined that the alpha1-Npp comprised 33% beta-sheet, whereas the variable region largely comprised non-periodic structure. Taken together, these results imply that the alpha1-Npp cannot be accommodated within the core of the fibril and that the variable region and/or minor helix facilitates its exclusion to the fibril surface. This provides further support for regulation of fibril diameter by steric hindrance or by interactions with other matrix components that affect fibrillogenesis.",4/14/00,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,11498-506,,15,275,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Circular Dichroism; Collagen/*chemistry; Cultured; Disulfides; Glycosylation; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Folding; Protein Structure; Rats; Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification; Secondary; Tumor Cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers approximately 99% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of approximately 1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death.

Numerous efforts have been made to identify reliable and predictive markers to detect the early signs of drug-induced injury to the liver, one of the most vulnerable organs in the body. These studies have, however, not delivered any more informative candidates than the serum aminotransferase markers that have been available for approximately 30 years. Using acetaminophen overdose-induced liver injury in the mouse as a model system, we have observed highly significant differences in the spectrum and levels of microRNAs in both liver tissues and in plasma between control and overdosed animals. Based on our survey of microRNA expression among normal tissues, some of the microRNAs, like messenger RNAs, display restricted tissue distributions. A number of elevated circulating microRNAs in plasma collected from acetaminophen-overdosed animals are highly expressed in the liver. We have demonstrated that specific microRNA species, such as mir-122 and mir-192, both are enriched in the liver tissue and exhibit dose- and exposure duration-dependent changes in the plasma that parallel serum aminotransferase levels and the histopathology of liver degeneration, but their changes can be detected significantly earlier.

In this study, we establish evolutionary conservation in teleost fish of key components of the TLR-signaling pathway that act as switches for differential gene induction, including MYD88, TIRAP, TRIF, TRAF6, IRF3, and IRF7. We further explore this conservation with a molecular phylogenetic analysis of MYD88. To the extent that current genomic analysis can establish, each vertebrate has one ortholog to each of these genes. For molecular tree construction and phylogeny inference, we demonstrate a methodology for including genes with only partial primary sequences without disrupting the topology provided by the high-confidence full-length sequences. Conservation of the TLR-signaling molecules suggests that the basic program of gene regulation by the TLR-signaling pathway is conserved across vertebrates. To test this hypothesis, leukocytes from a model fish, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), were stimulated with known mammalian TLR agonists including: diacylated and triacylated forms of lipoprotein, flagellin, two forms of LPS, synthetic double-stranded RNA, and two imidazoquinoline compounds (loxoribine and R848). Trout leukocytes responded in vitro to a number of these agonists with distinct patterns of cytokine expression that correspond to mammalian responses. Our results support the key prediction from our phylogenetic analyses that strong selective pressure of pathogenic microbes has preserved both TLR recognition and signaling functions during vertebrate evolution.",2006-03,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,77-88,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Late detection and the aggressive nature of high-grade astrocytomas contribute to high mortality rates. Though many studies identify candidate biomarkers using high-throughput transcriptomic profiling to stratify grades and subtypes, few have resulted in clinically actionable results. This shortcoming can be attributed, in part, to pronounced lab effects that reduce signature robustness and varied individual gene expression among patients with the same tumor. We addressed these issues by uniformly preprocessing publicly available transcriptomic data, comprising 306 tumor samples from three astrocytoma grades (Grade 2, 3, and 4) and 30 non-tumor samples (normal brain as control tissues). Utilizing Differential Rank Conservation (DIRAC), a network-based classification approach, we examined the global and individual patterns of network regulation across tumor grades. Additionally, we applied gene-based approaches to identify genes whose expression changed consistently with increasing tumor grade and evaluated their robustness across multiple studies using statistical sampling. Applying DIRAC, we observed a global trend of greater network dysregulation with increasing tumor aggressiveness. Individual networks displaying greater differences in regulation between adjacent grades play well-known roles in calcium/PKC, EGF, and transcription signaling. Interestingly, many of the 90 individual genes found to monotonically increase or decrease with astrocytoma grade are implicated in cancers-affected processes such as calcium signaling, mitochondrial metabolism, and apoptosis. The fact that specific genes monotonically increase or decrease with increasing astrocytoma grade may reflect shared oncogenic mechanisms among phenotypically similar tumors. This work presents statistically significant results that enable better characterization of different human astrocytoma grades and hopefully can contribute towards improvements in diagnosis and therapy choices. Our results also identify a number of testable hypotheses relating to astrocytoma etiology that may prove helpful in developing much-needed biomarkers for earlier disease detection.",2013,2/8/16 23:58,2/9/16 0:19,,,,10,8,,PLoS One,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,"*Gene Expression Profiling; *Genetic Heterogeneity; Algorithms; Astrocytoma/*genetics/*pathology; Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology; Carcinogenesis/genetics/pathology; Databases, Genetic; Disease Progression; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genes, Neoplasm; Humans; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major Escherichia coli pathway of DNA break repair requires RecBCD enzyme, a complex protein machine with multiple activities. Upon encountering a Chi recombination hotspot (5' GCTGGTGG 3') during DNA unwinding, RecBCD's unwinding, nuclease, and RecA-loading activities change dramatically, but the physical basis for these changes is unknown. Here, we identify, during RecBCD's DNA unwinding, two Chi-stimulated conformational changes involving RecC. One produced a marked, long-lasting, Chi-dependent increase in protease sensitivity of a small patch, near the Chi recognition domain, on the solvent-exposed RecC surface. The other change was identified by crosslinking of an artificial amino acid inserted in this RecC patch to RecB. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis confirmed a major conformational change upon binding of DNA to the enzyme and is consistent with these two changes. We propose that, upon DNA binding, the RecB nuclease domain swings from one side of RecC to the other; when RecBCD encounters Chi, the nuclease domain returns to its initial position determined by crystallography, where it nicks DNA exiting from RecC and loads RecA onto the newly generated 3'-ended single-stranded DNA during continued unwinding; a crevice between RecB and RecC increasingly narrows during these steps. This model provides a physical basis for the intramolecular ""signal transduction"" from Chi to RecC to RecD to RecB inferred previously from genetic and enzymatic analyses, and it accounts for the enzymatic changes that accompany Chi's stimulation of recombination.",10/23/14,2/5/16 22:14,2/5/16 23:15,,3479-3499,,21,426,,J.

Flagellin, a principal component of bacterial flagella, is a virulence factor that is recognized by the innate immune system in organisms as diverse as flies, plants and mammals. Here we report that mammalian TLR5 recognizes bacterial flagellin from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and that activation of the receptor mobilizes the nuclear factor NF-kappaB and stimulates tumour necrosis factor-alpha production. TLR5-stimulating activity was purified from Listeria monocytogenes culture supernatants and identified as flagellin by tandem mass spectrometry. Expression of L. monocytogenes flagellin in non-flagellated Escherichia coli conferred on the bacterium the ability to activate TLR5, whereas deletion of the flagellin genes from Salmonella typhimurium abrogated TLR5-stimulating activity. All known TLRs signal through the adaptor protein MyD88. Mice challenged with bacterial flagellin rapidly produced systemic interleukin-6, whereas MyD88-null mice did not respond to flagellin.

Initial scans of allelic association were followed by more detailed logistic regression modeling that adjusted for known type I diabetes risk factors and potential confounding variables. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6598, located in a polyadenylation signal of GIMAP5, was associated with the presence of significant levels of IA-2 autoantibodies in the type I diabetes patients. Patients with the minor allele A of rs6598 had an increased prevalence of IA-2 autoantibody levels compared to patients without the minor allele (OR=2.2; Bonferroni-corrected P=0.003), after adjusting for age at clinical onset (P=8.0 x 10(-13)) and the numbers of HLA-DQ A1*0501-B1*0201 haplotypes (P=2.4 x 10(-5)) and DQ A1*0301-B1*0302 haplotypes (P=0.002).

In two Prnp-deficient (Prnp(0/0)) mouse lines (Ngsk and Rcm0), Dpl overexpression correlated with ataxia and death of cerebellar neurons. To determine whether Dpl overexpression, rather than the dysregulation of genes neighboring the Prn gene complex, was responsible for the ataxic syndrome, we placed the mouse Dpl coding sequence under the control of the Prnp promoter and produced transgenic (Tg) mice on the Prnp(0/0)-ZrchI background (hereafter referred to as ZrchI). ZrchI mice exhibit neither Dpl overexpression nor cerebellar degeneration. In contrast, Tg(Dpl)ZrchI mice showed cerebellar granule and Purkinje cell loss; the age of onset of ataxia was inversely proportional to the levels of Dpl protein. Crosses of Tg mice overexpressing wild-type PrP with two lines of Tg(Dpl)ZrchI mice resulted in a phenotypic rescue of the ataxic syndrome, while Dpl overexpression was unchanged. Restoration of PrP expression also rendered the Tg(Dpl) mice susceptible to prion infection, with incubation times indistinguishable from non-Tg controls. Whereas the rescue of Dpl-induced neurotoxicity by coexpression of PrP argues for an interaction between the PrP and Dpl proteins in vivo, the unaltered incubation times in Tg mice overexpressing Dpl in the central nervous system suggest that Dpl is unlikely to be involved in prion formation.",12/18/01,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,15288-93,,26,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Ataxia/genetics; Cerebellum/anatomy & histology/ pathology; Genetic; Mice; Phenotype; Prions/genetics/ physiology; Promoter Regions; Transgenic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that polymorphisms in the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) gene, for a cytosolic receptor known to detect mycobacteria, are associated with susceptibility to leprosy and its clinical outcomes. METHODS: We used a case-control study design with 933 patients in Nepal. Our study included 240 patients with type 1 (reversal) reactions and 124 patients with type 2 (erythema nodosum leprosum) reactions. We compared the frequencies of 32 common polymorphisms in the NOD2 gene region between patients with the different clinical types of leprosy as well as between the patients and 101 control participants without leprosy. RESULTS: Four polymorphisms were associated with susceptibility to leprosy when comparing allele frequencies, and 8 were associated when comparing genotype frequencies with a dominant model. Five polymorphisms were associated with protection from reversal reaction in an allelic analysis, and 7 were associated with reversal reaction with a dominant model. Four polymorphisms were associated with increased susceptibility to erythema nodosum leprosum in an allelic analysis, whereas 7 of 32 polymorphisms were associated with a dominant model.

Only when data can be easily exchanged will the entire biological community be able to derive the full benefit from such microarray studies. RESULTS: To this end we have developed three key ingredients towards standardizing the storage and exchange of microarray data. First, we have created a minimal information for the annotation of a microarray experiment (MIAME)-compliant conceptualization of microarray experiments modeled using the unified modeling language (UML) named MAGE-OM (microarray gene expression object model). Second, we have translated MAGE-OM into an XML-based data format, MAGE-ML, to facilitate the exchange of data. Third, some of us are now using MAGE (or its progenitors) in data production settings. Finally, we have developed a freely available software tool kit (MAGE-STK) that eases the integration of MAGE-ML into end usersâ€°Ã›Âª systems.

Some are indolent; others quickly progress to glioblastoma. The uncertainty is compounded by interobserver variability in histologic diagnosis. Mutations in IDH, TP53, and ATRX and codeletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q (1p/19q codeletion) have been implicated as clinically relevant markers of lower-grade gliomas. METHODS: We performed genomewide analyses of 293 lower-grade gliomas from adults, incorporating exome sequence, DNA copy number, DNA methylation, messenger RNA expression, microRNA expression, and targeted protein expression. These data were integrated and tested for correlation with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Unsupervised clustering of mutations and data from RNA, DNA-copy-number, and DNA-methylation platforms uncovered concordant classification of three robust, nonoverlapping, prognostically significant subtypes of lower-grade glioma that were captured more accurately by IDH, 1p/19q, and TP53 status than by histologic class. Patients who had lower-grade gliomas with an IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion had the most favorable clinical outcomes. Their gliomas harbored mutations in CIC, FUBP1, NOTCH1, and the TERT promoter. Nearly all lower-grade gliomas with IDH mutations and no 1p/19q codeletion had mutations in TP53 (94%) and ATRX inactivation (86%). The large majority of lower-grade gliomas without an IDH mutation had genomic aberrations and clinical behavior strikingly similar to those found in primary glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of genomewide data from multiple platforms delineated three molecular classes of lower-grade gliomas that were more concordant with IDH, 1p/19q, and TP53 status than with histologic class. Lower-grade gliomas with an IDH mutation either had 1p/19q codeletion or carried a TP53 mutation. Most lower-grade gliomas without an IDH mutation were molecularly and clinically similar to glioblastoma.

However, whether chromatin remodeling complexes have the ability to regulate nonchromatin substrates remains unclear. Saccharomyces cerevisiae checkpoint kinase Mec1 (ATR in mammals) is an essential master regulator of genomic integrity. Here we found that the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is capable of regulating Mec1 kinase activity. In vivo, Mec1 activity is reduced by the deletion of Snf2, the core ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF complex. SWI/SNF interacts with Mec1, and cross-linking studies revealed that the Snf2 ATPase is the main interaction partner for Mec1. In vitro, SWI/SNF can activate Mec1 kinase activity in the absence of chromatin or known activators such as Dpb11. The subunit requirement of SWI/SNF-mediated Mec1 regulation differs from that of SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling. Functionally, SWI/SNF-mediated Mec1 regulation specifically occurs in S phase of the cell cycle. Together, these findings identify a novel regulator of Mec1 kinase activity and suggest that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes can regulate nonchromatin substrates such as a checkpoint kinase.",3/15/15,2/5/16 22:14,2/9/16 0:19,,591-602,,6,29,,Genes Dev.,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 25792597 PMCID: PMC4378192,,,,,"Adenosine Triphosphatases; ATR; checkpoint regulation; Chromatin; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; chromatin remodeling; Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone; DNA Damage; Enzyme Activation; Enzyme Activators; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Mec1; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; S Phase; SWI/SNF; Transcription Factors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spectral library searching has several advantages over conventional sequence searching: it is generally much faster, and has higher specificity and sensitivity. The speed increase is primarily, due to having a smaller, fully indexable search space of real spectra that are known to be observable. The increase in specificity and sensitivity is primarily due to the ability of a search engine to utilize the known intensities of the fragment ions, rather than just comparing with theoretical spectra as is done with sequence searching. The main disadvantage of spectral library searching is that one can only identify peptide ions that have been seen before and are stored in the spectral library.

The molecular phylogeny of mechanisms driving these rhythms has been difficult to dissect because identified clock genes and proteins are not conserved across the domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota. Here we show that oxidation-reduction cycles of peroxiredoxin proteins constitute a universal marker for circadian rhythms in all domains of life, by characterizing their oscillations in a variety of model organisms.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that modulate the levels of specific genes and proteins. Identifying expression patterns of miRNAs in COPD may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of disease. A study was undertaken to determine if miRNAs are differentially expressed in the lungs of smokers with and without COPD. miRNA and mRNA expression were compared to enrich for biological networks relevant to the pathogenesis of COPD. METHODS: Lung tissue from smokers with no evidence of obstructive lung disease (n=9) and smokers with COPD (n=26) was examined for miRNA and mRNA expression followed by validation. We then examined both miRNA and mRNA expression to enrich for relevant biological pathways. RESULTS: 70 miRNAs and 2667 mRNAs were differentially expressed between lung tissue from subjects with COPD and smokers without COPD. miRNA and mRNA expression profiles enriched for biological pathways that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of COPD including the transforming growth factor beta, Wnt and focal adhesion pathways. miR-223 and miR-1274a were the most affected miRNAs in subjects with COPD compared with smokers without obstruction. miR-15b was increased in COPD samples compared with smokers without obstruction and localised to both areas of emphysema and fibrosis. miR-15b was differentially expressed within GOLD classes of COPD. Expression of SMAD7, which was validated as a target for miR-15b, was decreased in bronchial epithelial cells in COPD. CONCLUSIONS: miRNA and mRNA are differentially expressed in individuals with COPD compared with smokers without obstruction.

After induced damage, muscle in mice lacking p38-gamma generated significantly fewer myofibers than wild-type muscle. Notably, p38-gamma-deficient muscle contained 50% fewer satellite cells that exhibited premature Myogenin expression and markedly reduced proliferation. We determined that p38-gamma directly phosphorylated MyoD on Ser199 and Ser200, which results in enhanced occupancy of MyoD on the promoter of myogenin together with markedly decreased transcriptional activity. This repression is associated with extensive methylation of histone H3K9 together with recruitment of the KMT1A methyltransferase to the myogenin promoter. Notably, a MyoD S199A/S200A mutant exhibits markedly reduced binding to KMT1A. Therefore, p38-gamma signaling directly induces the assembly of a repressive MyoD transcriptional complex.

These linkages are regulated by the conserved Aurora B/Ipl1 kinase to ensure that sister chromatids are properly attached to spindle microtubules. Kinetochore-microtubule attachments require the essential Ndc80 complex, which contains two globular ends linked by large coiled-coil domains. In this study, we isolated a novel ndc80 mutant in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that contains mutations in the coiled-coil domain. This ndc80 mutant accumulates erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments, resulting in misalignment of kinetochores on the mitotic spindle. Genetic analyses with suppressors of the ndc80 mutant and in vitro cross-linking experiments suggest that the kinetochore misalignment in vivo stems from a defect in the ability of the Ndc80 complex to stably fold at a hinge in the coiled coil. Previous studies proposed that the Ndc80 complex can exist in multiple conformations: elongated during metaphase and bent during anaphase. However, the distinct functions of individual conformations in vivo are unknown. Here, our analysis revealed a tightly folded conformation of the Ndc80 complex that is likely required early in mitosis. This conformation is mediated by a direct, intra-complex interaction and involves a greater degree of folding than the bent form of the complex at anaphase. Furthermore, our results suggest that this conformation is functionally important in vivo for efficient error correction by Aurora B/Ipl1 and, consequently, to ensure proper kinetochore alignment early in mitosis.",9/16/14,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While T-cell specification is driven by Notch signaling, T-lineage commitment is only finalized after prolonged Notch activation. However, no T-lineage specific regulatory factor has been reported that mediates commitment. We used a gene-discovery approach to identify additional candidate T-lineage transcription factors and characterized expression of >100 regulatory genes in early T-cell precursors using realtime RT-PCR. These regulatory genes were also monitored in multilineage precursors as they entered T-cell or non-T-cell pathways in vitro; in non-T cells ex vivo; and in later T-cell developmental stages after lineage commitment. At least three major expression patterns were observed. Transcription factors in the largest group are expressed at relatively stable levels throughout T-lineage specification as a legacy from prethymic precursors, with some continuing while others are downregulated after commitment. Another group is highly expressed in the earliest stages only, and is downregulated before or during commitment. Genes in a third group undergo upregulation at one of three distinct transitions, suggesting a positive regulatory cascade. However, the transcription factors induced during commitment are not T-lineage specific. Different members of the same transcription factor family can follow opposite trajectories during specification and commitment, while factors co-expressed early can be expressed in divergent patterns in later T-cell development. Some factors reveal new regulatory distinctions between alphabeta and gammadelta T-lineage differentiation.

In particular, generation of MS(3) spectra in a data-dependent manner upon detection of the neutral loss of a phosphoric acid in MS(2) spectra is a popular technique for circumventing the problem of poor phosphopeptide backbone fragmentation. The newer Multistage Activation method provides another option. Both these strategies require additional cycle time on the instrument and therefore reduce the number of spectra that can be measured in the same amount of time. Additional informatics is often required to make most efficient use of the additional information provided by these spectra as well. This work presents a comparison of several commonly used mass spectrometry methods for the study of phosphopeptide-enriched samples: an MS(2)-only method, a Multistage Activation method, and an MS(2)/MS(3) data-dependent neutral loss method.

Here we describe the synthesis of superparamagnetic silica particles with hydrazide groups on the surface and further evaluate their use as the solid support for SPEG. We produced nonspherical silica particles containing superparamagnetic iron oxide cores using a modified Stober method and then derivatized their surface with hydrazide-terminated silane. Such composite particles displayed a strong response to the external magnetic field, and this feature enabled us to capture and release the particles easily for automated, high-throughput sample preparation of glycopeptides. When measured with standard glycoproteins, the adsorption capacity of these particles was >36 mg of glycoproteins per g of nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were used in a microtiter plate format for glycopeptide capture using a liquid handler. The captured glycopeptides were then analyzed by LC-MS and LC-MS/MS to determine the specificity and reproducibility of glycopeptide isolation.

This program includes searching through DNA sequences to identify ""motifs"" that serve as the binding sites for transcription factors or, more generally, are predictive of gene expression across cellular conditions. Several approaches have been proposed for de novo motif discovery-searching sequences without prior knowledge of binding sites or nucleotide patterns. However, unbiased validation is not straightforward. We consider two approaches to unbiased validation of discovered motifs: testing the statistical significance of a motif using a DNA ""background"" sequence model to represent the null hypothesis and measuring performance in predicting membership in gene clusters. We demonstrate that the background models typically used are ""too null,"" resulting in overly optimistic assessments of significance, and argue that performance in predicting TF binding or expression patterns from DNA motifs should be assessed by held-out data, as in predictive learning. Applying this criterion to common motif discovery methods resulted in universally poor performance, although there is a marked improvement when motifs are statistically significant against real background sequences. Moreover, on synthetic data where ""ground truth"" is known, discriminative performance of all algorithms is far below the theoretical upper bound, with pronounced ""over-fitting"" in training. A key conclusion from this work is that the failure of de novo discovery approaches to accurately identify motifs is basically due to statistical intractability resulting from the fixed size of co-regulated gene clusters, and thus such failures do not necessarily provide evidence that unfound motifs are not active biologically. Consequently, the use of prior knowledge to enhance motif discovery is not just advantageous but necessary.

The core problem is essentially that of classification of the relationships among phenotypes of mutant strains into biologically informative ""rules"" of gene interaction. Geneticists have determined such classifications based on insights from biological examples, but it is not clear that there is a systematic, unsupervised way to extract this information. In this paper we describe such a method that depends on maximizing a previously described context-dependent information measure to obtain maximally informative biological networks. We have successfully validated this method on two examples from yeast by demonstrating that more biological information is obtained when analysis is guided by this information measure. The context-dependent information measure is a function only of phenotype data and a set of interaction rules, involving no prior biological knowledge. Analysis of the resulting networks reveals that the most biologically informative networks are those with the greatest context-dependent information scores. We propose that these high-complexity networks reveal genetic architecture at a modular level, in contrast to classical genetic interaction rules that order genes in pathways. We suggest that our analysis represents a powerful, data-driven, and general approach to genetic interaction analysis, with particular potential in the study of mammalian systems in which interactions are complex and gene annotation data are sparse.",2009-04,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,e1000347,,4,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Algorithms; *Models; Computer Simulation; Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology; Genetic; Information Storage and Retrieval; Protein Interaction Mapping/*methods; Proteome/*genetics; Signal Transduction/*genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MRM-MS sensitivity depends critically on the tuning of instrument parameters, such as collision energy and cone voltage, for the generation of maximal product ion signal. Although generalized equations and values exist for such instrument parameters, there is no clear indication that optimal signal can be reliably produced for all types of MRM transitions using such an algorithmic approach. To address this issue, we have devised a workflow functional on both Waters Quattro Premier and ABI 4000 QTRAP triple quadrupole instruments that allows rapid determination of the optimal value of any programmable instrument parameter for each MRM transition. Here, we demonstrate the strategy for the optimizations of collision energy and cone voltage, but the method could be applied to other instrument parameters, such as declustering potential, as well. The workflow makes use of the incremental adjustment of the precursor and product m/z values at the hundredth decimal place to create a series of MRM targets at different collision energies that can be cycled through in rapid succession within a single run, avoiding any run-to-run variability in execution or comparison.

Genome-wide transcriptome profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies identified a role for Htz1p in the rapid and robust activation of many oleate-responsive genes encoding peroxisomal proteins, in particular POT1, POX1, FOX2, and CTA1. The Swr1p-, Gcn5p-, and Chz1p-dependent association of Htz1p with these promoters in their repressed states appears to establish an epigenetic marker for the rapid and strong expression of these highly inducible promoters. Isw2p also plays a role in establishing the nucleosome state of these promoters and associates stably in the absence of Htz1p. An analysis of the nucleosome dynamics and Htz1p association with these promoters suggests a complex mechanism in which Htz1p-containing nucleosomes at fatty acid-responsive promoters are disassembled upon initial exposure to oleic acid leading to the loss of Htz1p from the promoter. These nucleosomes reassemble at later stages of gene expression.

SAGA-TBP binding involves a network of interactions between subunits Spt3, Spt8, Spt20, and Spt7. The HAT and DUB modules are in close proximity, and the DUB module modestly stimulates HAT function.

Growth factors may promote cell survival at least partially through phosphorylation of Bad at one or more of Ser-112, -136, or -155. Our previous work showed that Bad is also phosphorylated in response to cytokines at another site, which we now identify as Ser-170. The functional role of this novel phosphorylation site was assessed by site-directed mutagenesis and analysis of the pro-apoptotic function of Bad in transiently transfected HEK293 and COS-7 cells or by stable expression in the cytokine-dependent cell line, MC/9. In general, mutation of Ser-170 to Ala results in a protein with increased ability to induce apoptosis, similar to the S112A mutant. Mutation of Ser-170 to Asp, mimicking a constitutively phosphorylated site, results in a protein that is virtually unable to induce apoptosis. Similarly, the S112A/S170D double mutant does not cause apoptosis in HEK293 and MC/9 cell lines.

We present a third orthogonal approach to gene prediction, based on detecting the genomic signatures of transcription, accumulated over evolutionary time. We discuss four algorithms based on this third concept: Greens and CHOWDER, which quantify mutational strand biases caused by transcription-coupled DNA repair, and ROAST and PASTA, which are based on strand-specific selection against polyadenylation signals. We combined these algorithms into an integrated method called FEAST, which we used to predict the location and orientation of thousands of putative transcription units not overlapping known genes. Many of the newly predicted transcriptional units do not appear to code for proteins. The new algorithms are particularly apt at detecting genes with long introns and lacking sequence conservation. They therefore complement existing gene prediction methods and will help identify functional transcripts within many apparent ""genomic deserts.""",2006-03,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,e18,,3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Algorithms; Computational Biology/ methods; DNA/ methods; DNA Repair; Evolution; Gene Expression Profiling/ methods; Humans; Models; Molecular; Mutation; Sequence Analysis; Software; Statistical; Time Factors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a flexible, probabilistic framework to predict TF binding from multiple data sources that differs from the standard hypothesis testing (scanning) methods in several ways. Our probabilistic modeling framework estimates the probability of binding and, thus, naturally reflects our degree of belief in binding. Probabilistic modeling also allows for easy and systematic integration of our binding predictions into other probabilistic modeling methods, such as expression-based gene network inference. The method answers the question of whether the whole analyzed promoter has a binding site, but can also be extended to estimate the binding probability at each nucleotide position. Further, we introduce an extension to model combinatorial regulation by several TFs. Most importantly, the proposed methods can make principled probabilistic inference from multiple evidence sources, such as, multiple statistical models (motifs) of the TFs, evolutionary conservation, regulatory potential, CpG islands, nucleosome positioning, DNase hypersensitive sites, ChIP-chip binding segments and other (prior) sequence-based biological knowledge. We developed both a likelihood and a Bayesian method, where the latter is implemented with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Results on a carefully constructed test set from the mouse genome demonstrate that principled data fusion can significantly improve the performance of TF binding prediction methods. We also applied the probabilistic modeling framework to all promoters in the mouse genome and the results indicate a sparse connectivity between transcriptional regulators and their target promoters. To facilitate analysis of other sequences and additional data, we have developed an on-line web tool, ProbTF, which implements our probabilistic TF binding prediction method using multiple data sources.

SifA localizes to the phagosome and interacts with the membrane via its prenylated tail. SifA is a structural homologue of another bacterial effector that acts as a GTP-exchange factor for Rho family GTPases and can bind GDP-RhoA. When coexpressed with a bacterial lipase that is activated by RhoA, SifA can induce tubulation of mammalian endosomes. In an effort to develop a genetic system to study SifA function, we expressed SifA and characterized its activity in yeast. GFP-SifA predominantly localized to yeast peroxisomal membranes. Under peroxisome-inducing conditions, GFP-SifA reduced the number of free peroxisomes and promoted the formation of large peroxisomes with membrane invaginations. GFP-SifA activity depended on the recruitment to peroxisomes of wild-type Rho1p and Pex25p, a receptor for Rho1p. GFP-SifA could also rescue the actin organization defects in pex25Delta and rho1 mutants, suggesting that SifA may recruit and potentiate Rho1p activity. We reexamined the distribution of GFP-SifA in mammalian cells and found the majority colocalizing with LAMP1-positive compartment and not with the peroxisomal marker PMP70. Together, these data suggest that SifA may use a similar mode of action via Rho proteins to alter yeast peroxisomal and mammalian endosomal membranes. Further definition of SifA activity on yeast peroxisomes could provide more insight into its role in regulating host membrane dynamics and small GTPases.",10/15/10,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,3567-77,,20,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous genes relocate from the nuclear periphery to the nuclear interior upon activation and are hypothesized to interact with pre-assembled sites of transcription. In contrast to the nuclear interior, the nuclear periphery is widely regarded as transcriptionally silent. This is reflected by the preferential association of heterochromatin with the nuclear envelope (NE). However, some activated genes are recruited to the nuclear periphery through interactions with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), and NPC components are capable of preventing the spread of silent chromatin into adjacent regions of active chromatin, leading to the speculation that NPCs may facilitate the transition of chromatin between transcriptional states. Thus, the NE might better be considered as a discontinuous platform that promotes both gene activation and repression. As such, it is perhaps not surprising that many disease states are frequently associated with alterations in the NE. Here, we review the effects of the NE and its constituents on chromatin organization and gene expression.",2011-03,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,147-66,,2,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this regard, contemporary genomes can be used as molecular records that reveal associations of various genes working in their natural lifestyles. By analyzing thousands of orthologs across approximately 600 bacterial species, we constructed a map of gene-gene co-occurrence across much of the sequenced biome. If genes preferentially co-occur in the same organisms, they were called herein correlogs; in the opposite case, called anti-correlogs. To quantify correlogy and anti-correlogy, we alleviated the contribution of indirect correlations between genes by adapting ideas developed for reverse engineering of transcriptional regulatory networks. Resultant correlogous associations are highly enriched for physically interacting proteins and for co-expressed transcripts, clearly differentiating a subgroup of functionally-obligatory protein interactions from conditional or transient interactions. Other biochemical and phylogenetic properties were also found to be reflected in correlogous and anti-correlogous relationships. Additionally, our study elucidates the global organization of the gene association map, in which various modules of correlogous genes are strikingly interconnected by anti-correlogous crosstalk between the modules. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of such associations along different domains of life and environmental microbial communities. These phylogenetic profiling approaches infer functional coupling of genes regardless of mechanistic details, and may be useful to guide exogenous gene import in synthetic biology.",2011-12,2/8/16 23:58,2/9/16 0:19,,,,12,7,,PLoS Comput Biol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,"Bacteria/*genetics; Computational Biology/*methods; Environment; Evolution, Molecular; Gastrointestinal Tract/microbiology; Gene Expression Profiling/*methods; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genes, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Humans; Models, Biological; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inflammasome containing the nucleotide binding domain-leucine-rich repeat (NBD-LRR) protein NLRC4 (interleukin-converting enzyme protease-activating factor [IPAF]) responds to the cytosolic presence of bacterial proteins such as flagellin or the inner rod component of bacterial type III secretion systems (e.g., Salmonella PrgJ). In some instances, such as infection with Legionella pneumophila, the activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome requires the presence of a second NBD-LRR protein, NAIP5. NAIP5 also is required for NLRC4 activation by the minimal C-terminal flagellin peptide, which is sufficient to activate NLRC4. However, NLRC4 activation is not always dependent upon NAIP5. In this report, we define the molecular requirements for NAIP5 in the activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome. We demonstrate that the N terminus of flagellin can relieve the requirement for NAIP5 during the activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome.

To date, most studies in this field have focused on the use of linear constraints, resulting from mass balance and capacity constraints, which lead to the definition of convex solution spaces. One additional constraint arising out of thermodynamics is known as the ""loop law"" for reaction fluxes, which states that the net flux around a closed biochemical loop must be zero because no net thermodynamic driving force exists. The imposition of the loop-law can lead to nonconvex solution spaces making the analysis of the consequences of its imposition challenging. A four-step approach is developed here to apply the loop-law to study metabolic network properties: 1), determine linear equality constraints that are necessary (but not necessarily sufficient) for thermodynamic feasibility; 2), tighten V(max) and V(min) constraints to enclose the remaining nonconvex space; 3), uniformly sample the convex space that encloses the nonconvex space using standard Monte Carlo techniques; and 4), eliminate from the resulting set all solutions that violate the loop-law, leaving a subset of steady-state solutions. This subset of solutions represents a uniform random sample of the space that is defined by the additional imposition of the loop-law.

A network of four (predicted) regulators of the response (Oaf1p, Pip2p, Adr1p and Oaf3p) was investigated. By analyzing trends in the network structure, we found that two groups of multi-input motifs form in response to oleate, each controlling distinct functional classes of genes. This functionality is contributed in part by Oaf1p, which is a component of both types of multi-input motifs and has two different regulatory activities depending on its binding context. The dynamic cooperation between Oaf1p and Pip2p appears to temporally synchronize the two different responses.

Although SPRi is capable of determining binding constants for multiple ligands in parallel, current commercial instruments are limited to a single analyte stream on multiple ligand spots. Measurement of binding kinetics requires the serial introduction of different analyte concentrations; such repeated experiments are conducted manually and are therefore time-intensive. To address these challenges, we have developed an integrated microfluidic array using soft lithography techniques for high-throughput SPRi-based detection and determination of binding affinities of antibodies against protein targets. The device consists of 264 element-addressable chambers isolated by microvalves. The resulting 700 pL chamber volumes, combined with a serial dilution network for simultaneous interrogation of up to six different analyte concentrations, allow for further speeding detection times. To test for device performance, human alpha-thrombin was immobilized on the sensor surface and anti-human alpha-thrombin IgG was injected across the surface at different concentrations. The equilibrium dissociation constant was determined to be 5.0 +/- 1.9 nM, which agrees well with values reported in the literature. The interrogation of multiple ligands to multiple analytes in a single device was also investigated and samples were recovered with no cross-contamination. Since each chamber can be addressed independently, this array is capable of interrogating binding events from up to 264 different immobilized ligands against multiple analytes in a single experiment.

However, regulatory mechanisms that establish homeostasis are not well understood in organisms that dwell in environments at the extremes of pH, temperature, and salinity. Under conditions of limited iron, the extremophile Halobacterium salinarum, a salt-loving archaeon, mounts a specific response to scavenge iron for growth. We have identified and characterized the role of two transcription factors (TFs), Idr1 and Idr2, in regulating this important response. An integrated systems analysis of TF knockout gene expression profiles and genome-wide binding locations in the presence and absence of iron has revealed that these TFs operate collaboratively to maintain iron homeostasis. In the presence of iron, Idr1 and Idr2 bind near each other at 24 loci in the genome, where they are both required to repress some genes. By contrast, Idr1 and Idr2 are both necessary to activate other genes in a putative a feed forward loop. Even at loci bound independently, the two TFs target different genes with similar functions in iron homeostasis.

Here we report that many Vbeta segments are detectably transcribed in Rag2(-/-) thymocytes and that there are significant differences in expression among different Vbeta segments. Primer extension and characterization of cDNA clones from SCID thymocytes suggest that these germline Vbeta transcripts generally use the same start sites as those previously determined in mature T cells. The strength of expression before rearrangement does not correlate with proximity to the known enhancer, because members of the most distal Vbeta cluster (Vbeta2.1, Vbeta1.1, Vbeta4.1) are relatively strongly expressed and more proximal Vbeta segments (Vbeta14.1, Vbeta3.1, Vbeta7.1, Vbeta6.1) are only weakly expressed.

They challenge Edmund Husserl's rejection of naturalism and his attempt to establish phenomenology as a foundational transcendental discipline, and they challenge efforts to explain cognition through mainstream science. While appearing to be a retreat from the bold claims made for phenomenology, it is really its triumph. Naturalized phenomenology is spearheading a successful challenge to the heritage of Cartesian dualism. This converges with the reaction against Cartesian thought within science itself. Descartes divided the universe between res cogitans, thinking substances, and res extensa, the mechanical world. The latter won with Newton and we have, in most of objective science since, literally lost our mind, hence our humanity. Despite Darwin, biologists remain children of Newton, and dream of a grand theory that is epistemologically complete and would allow lawful entailment of the evolution of the biosphere. This dream is no longer tenable. We now have to recognize that science and scientists are within and part of the world we are striving to comprehend, as proponents of endophysics have argued, and that physics, biology and mathematics have to be reconceived accordingly. Interpreting quantum mechanics from this perspective is shown to both illuminate conscious experience and reveal new paths for its further development. In biology we must now justify the use of the word ""function"". As we shall see, we cannot prestate the ever new biological functions that arise and constitute the very phase space of evolution. Hence, we cannot mathematize the detailed becoming of the biosphere, nor write differential equations for functional variables we do not know ahead of time, nor integrate those equations, so no laws ""entail"" evolution. The dream of a grand theory fails. In place of entailing laws, a post-entailing law explanatory framework is proposed in which Actuals arise in evolution that constitute new boundary conditions that are enabling constraints that create new, typically unprestatable, Adjacent Possible opportunities for further evolution, in which new Actuals arise, in a persistent becoming. Evolution flows into a typically unprestatable succession of Adjacent Possibles. Given the concept of function, the concept of functional closure of an organism making a living in its world, becomes central. Implications for patterns in evolution include historical reconstruction, and statistical laws such as the distribution of extinction events, or species per genus, and the use of formal cause, not efficient cause, laws.",2015-12,2/8/16 18:55,2/9/16 0:19,,219-44,,,119,,Prog Biophys Mol Biol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,"<p>Kauffman, Stuart A<br/>Gare, Arran<br/>England<br/>Prog Biophys Mol Biol. 2015 Dec;119(3):219-44. doi: 10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2015.06.003.

The TLR2-mediated response to this modulin was enhanced by TLR6 but inhibited by TLR1, indicating a functional interaction between these receptors. We also demonstrate that a response to phenol-soluble modulin mediated by TLR2 and TLR6 was more refractory to inhibition by TLR1 than one mediated by TLR2 alone.",1/1/01,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,15-9,,1,166,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Drosophila Proteins; Animals; Bacterial Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology; Bacterial Toxins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism; Cell Line; Cell Surface/antagonists &; Cloning; Extracellular Space/immunology; Humans; Inbred C3H; inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology; Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists &; Mice; Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Phenols; Protein Structure; Receptors; Solubility; Staphylococcus epidermidis/*immunology; Tertiary/genetics/physiology; Toll-Like Receptor 1; Toll-Like Receptor 2; Toll-Like Receptor 4; Toll-Like Receptor 6; Toll-Like Receptors; Transfection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main purpose of this article is to show that this dream is false, and bears on studying patterns of evolution. To do so, I must justify the use of the word ""function"" in biology, when physics has only happenings. The concept of ""function"" lifts biology irreducibly above physics, for as we shall see, we cannot prestate the ever new biological functions that arise and constitute the very phase space of evolution. Hence, we cannot mathematize the detailed becoming of the biosphere, nor write differential equations for functional variables we do not know ahead of time, nor integrate those equations, so no laws ""entail"" evolution. The dream of a grand theory fails. In place of entailing laws, I propose a post-entailing law explanatory framework in which Actuals arise in evolution that constitute new boundary conditions that are enabling constraints that create new, typically unprestatable, adjacent possible opportunities for further evolution, in which new Actuals arise, in a persistent becoming. Evolution flows into a typically unprestatable succession of adjacent possibles. Given the concept of function, the concept of functional closure of an organism making a living in its world becomes central. Implications for patterns in evolution include historical reconstruction, and statistical laws such as the distribution of extinction events, or species per genus, and the use of formal cause, not efficient cause, laws.",4/3/14,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the many possible influences that could direct primordial network, six parameters emerge as the most influential when one considers the molecular characteristics of the best candidates for the emergence of biological information: polypeptides, RNA-like polymers, and lipids. These parameters are viable cores, connectivity kinetics, information control, scalability, resource availability, and compartmentalization.

Microbial production of phenylethanol currently relies on whole-cell bioconversion of phenylalanine with yeasts that harbour an Ehrlich pathway for phenylalanine catabolism. Complete biosynthesis of phenylethanol from a cheap carbon source, such as glucose, provides an economically attractive alternative for phenylalanine bioconversion. In this study, synthetic genetic array (SGA) screening was applied to identify genes involved in regulation of phenylethanol synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The screen focused on transcriptional regulation of ARO10, which encodes the major decarboxylase involved in conversion of phenylpyruvate to phenylethanol. A deletion in ARO8, which encodes an aromatic amino acid transaminase, was found to underlie the transcriptional upregulation of ARO10 during growth, with ammonium sulphate as the sole nitrogen source. Physiological characterization revealed that the aro8Ã«Ã“ mutation led to substantial changes in the absolute and relative intracellular concentrations of amino acids. Moreover, deletion of ARO8 led to de novo production of phenylethanol during growth on a glucose synthetic medium with ammonium as the sole nitrogen source. The aro8Ã«Ã“ mutation also stimulated phenylethanol production when combined with other, previously documented, mutations that deregulate aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae. The resulting engineered S. cerevisiae strain produced >3 mm phenylethanol from glucose during growth on a simple synthetic medium.

These matrices are frequently used to predict transcription factor binding sites in regulatory regions of DNA to complement and guide further experimental investigation. The DNA sequence preferences of transcription factors, encoded in PWMs, are dictated primarily by select residues within the DNA binding domain(s) that interact directly with DNA. Therefore, the DNA binding properties of homologous transcription factors with identical DNA binding domains may be characterized by PWMs derived from different species. Accordingly, we have implemented a fully automated domain-level homology searching method for identical DNA binding sequences.By applying the domain-level homology search to transcription factors with existing PWMs in the JASPAR and TRANSFAC databases, we were able to significantly increase coverage in terms of the total number of PWMs associated with a given species, assign PWMs to transcription factors that did not previously have any associations, and increase the number of represented species with PWMs over an order of magnitude. Additionally, using protein binding microarray (PBM) data, we have validated the domain-level method by demonstrating that transcription factor pairs with matching DNA binding domains exhibit comparable DNA binding specificity predictions to transcription factor pairs with completely identical sequences.The increased coverage achieved herein demonstrates the potential for more thorough species-associated investigation of protein-DNA interactions using existing resources. The PWM scanning results highlight the challenging nature of transcription factors that contain multiple DNA binding domains, as well as the impact of motif discovery on the ability to predict DNA binding properties. The method is additionally suitable for identifying domain-level homology mappings to enable utilization of additional information sources in the study of transcription factors. The domain-level homology search method, resulting PWM mappings, web-based user interface, and web API are publicly available at http://dodoma.systemsbiology.netdodoma.systemsbiology.net.",2012,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e42779,,8,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying mechanisms for rapid and stochastic changes in gene expression are unknown. Arabidopsis suecica is a natural allotetraploid derived from the extant A. thaliana and A. arenosa genomes that are homeologous in the allotetraploid. Here we report that RNAi of met1 reduced DNA methylation and altered the expression of approximately 200 genes, many of which encode transposons, predicted proteins, and centromeric and heterochromatic RNAs. Reduced DNA methylation occurred frequently in promoter regions of the upregulated genes, and an En/Spm-like transposon was reactivated in met1-RNAi A. suecica lines. Derepression of transposons, heterochromatic repeats, and centromeric small RNAs was primarily derived from the A. thaliana genome, and A. arenosa homeologous loci were less affected by methylation defects. A high level of A. thaliana centromeric small RNA accumulation was correlated with hypermethylation of A. thaliana centromeres. The greater effects of reduced DNA methylation on transposons and centromeric repeats in A. thaliana than in A. arenosa are consistent with the repression of many genes that are expressed at higher levels in A. thaliana than in A. arenosa in the resynthesized allotetraploids. Moreover, non-CG (CC) methylation in the promoter region of A. thaliana At2g23810 remained in the resynthesized allotetraploids, and the methylation spread within the promoter region in natural A. suecica, leading to silencing of At2g23810. At2g23810 was demethylated and reactivated in met1-RNAi A. suecica lines. We suggest that many A. thaliana genes are transcriptionally repressed in resynthesized allotetraploids, and a subset of A. thaliana loci including transposons and centromeric repeats are heavily methylated and subjected to homeologous genome-specific RNA-mediated DNA methylation in natural allopolyploids.",2008-04,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,1845-58,,,178,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Centromere; Chromosomes; DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase; DNA Methylation; DNA Transposable Elements; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes; Genetic; Genome; Heterochromatin; Plant; Polyploidy; Promoter Regions; RNA; RNA Interference; Small Interfering; Up-Regulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence a better understanding of the factors affecting kidney disease progression in T1D is urgently needed. In recent years microRNAs have emerged as important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in many different health conditions. We hypothesized that urinary microRNA profile of patients will differ in the different stages of diabetic renal disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied urine microRNA profiles with qPCR in 40 T1D with >20 year follow up 10 who never developed renal disease (N) matched against 10 patients who went on to develop overt nephropathy (DN), 10 patients with intermittent microalbuminuria (IMA) matched against 10 patients with persistent (PMA) microalbuminuria. A Bayesian procedure was used to normalize and convert raw signals to expression ratios. We applied formal statistical techniques to translate fold changes to profiles of microRNA targets which were then used to make inferences about biological pathways in the Gene Ontology and REACTOME structured vocabularies. A total of 27 microRNAs were found to be present at significantly different levels in different stages of untreated nephropathy. These microRNAs mapped to overlapping pathways pertaining to growth factor signaling and renal fibrosis known to be targeted in diabetic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary microRNA profiles differ across the different stages of diabetic nephropathy. Previous work using experimental, clinical chemistry or biopsy samples has demonstrated differential expression of many of these microRNAs in a variety of chronic renal conditions and diabetes. Combining expression ratios of microRNAs with formal inferences about their predicted mRNA targets and associated biological pathways may yield useful markers for early diagnosis and risk stratification of DN in T1D by inferring the alteration of renal molecular processes.",2013,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e54662,,1,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: miRNAs were present in all fluids tested and showed distinct compositions in different fluid types. Several of the highly abundant miRNAs in these fluids were common among multiple fluid types, and some of the miRNAs were enriched in specific fluids. We also observed distinct miRNA patterns in the urine samples obtained from individuals with different physiopathological conditions. CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNAs are ubiquitous in all the body fluid types tested. Fluid type-specific miRNAs may have functional roles associated with the surrounding tissues.

We propose a probabilistic method, called Geronemo, which directly aims to identify the mechanism by which genetic changes perturb the regulatory network. Geronemo automatically constructs a set of coregulated genes (modules), whose regulation can involve both sequence variations and expression of regulators. By exploiting the modularity of genetic regulatory systems, Geronemo reveals regulatory relationships that are indiscernible when genes are considered in isolation, allowing the recovery of intricate combinatorial regulation. By incorporating both expression and genotype of regulators, Geronemo captures cases where the effect of sequence variation on its targets is indirect. We applied Geronemo to a data set from the progeny generated by a cross between laboratory BY4716 (BY) and wild RM11-1a (RM) isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Geronemo produced previously undescribed hypotheses regarding genetic perturbations in the yeast regulatory network, including transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and chromatin modification. In particular, we find a large number of modules that have both chromosomal characteristics and are regulated by chromatin modification proteins. Indeed, a large fraction of the variance in the expression can be explained by a small number of markers associated with chromatin modifiers. Additional analysis reveals positive selection for sequence evolution of elements in the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex. Overall, our results suggest that a significant part of individual expression variation in yeast arises from evolution of a small number of chromatin structure modifiers.",9/19/06,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,14062-7,,38,103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Gene Expression Regulation; *Genetic Variation; *Models; *Polymorphism; Algorithms; Chromatin/*metabolism; Computer Simulation; Gene Expression Profiling; Genetic; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of Notch in various cell systems has been shown to regulate cell fate decisions. The sprouting of endothelial cells from microvessels, or angiogenesis, involves the modulation of the endothelial cell phenotype. Based on the function of other Notch family members and the expression pattern of Notch4, we postulated that Notch4 activation would modulate angiogenesis. Using an in vitro endothelial-sprouting assay, we show that expression of constitutively active Notch4 in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) inhibits endothelial sprouting. We also show that activated Notch4 inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane in vivo. Activated Notch4 does not inhibit HMEC-1 proliferation or migration through fibrinogen. However, migration through collagen is inhibited. Our data show that Notch4 cells exhibit increased beta1-integrin-mediated adhesion to collagen. HMEC-1 expressing activated Notch4 do not have increased surface expression of beta 1-integrins. Rather, we demonstrate that Notch4-expressing cells display beta1-integrin in an active, high-affinity conformation. Furthermore, using function-activating beta 1-integrin antibodies, we demonstrate that activation of beta1-integrins is sufficient to inhibit VEGF-induced endothelial sprouting in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo.

Because genes may be co-regulated only across a subset of all observed experimental conditions, biclustering (clustering of genes and conditions) is more appropriate than standard clustering. Co-regulated genes are also often functionally (physically, spatially, genetically, and/or evolutionarily) associated, and such a priori known or pre-computed associations can provide support for appropriately grouping genes. One important association is the presence of one or more common cis-regulatory motifs. In organisms where these motifs are not known, their de novo detection, integrated into the clustering algorithm, can help to guide the process towards more biologically parsimonious solutions. RESULTS: We have developed an algorithm, cMonkey, that detects putative co-regulated gene groupings by integrating the biclustering of gene expression data and various functional associations with the de novo detection of sequence motifs. CONCLUSIONS: We have applied this procedure to the archaeon Halobacterium NRC-1, as part of our efforts to decipher its regulatory network. In addition, we used cMonkey on public data for three organisms in the other two domains of life: Helicobacter pylori, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli. The biclusters detected by cMonkey both recapitulated known biology and enabled novel predictions (some for Halobacterium were subsequently confirmed in the laboratory). For example, it identified the bacteriorhodopsin regulon, assigned additional genes to this regulon with apparently unrelated function, and detected its known promoter motif. We have done a thorough comparison of cMonkey results against other clustering methods, and find that cMonkey biclusters are more parsimonious with all available evidence for co-regulation.",6/2/06,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,280,,1,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This test uses a statistical model to describe multiplicative and additive errors influencing an array experiment, where model parameters are estimated from observed intensities for all genes using the method of maximum likelihood. A generalized likelihood ratio test is performed for each gene to determine whether, under the model, these intensities are significantly different.

The commercial strong anion exchange expanded bed chromatography matrix, Q HyperZ, was treated with plasmas in one of two general ways. Using a purpose-designed rotating reactor, plasmas were employed to either: (i) remove anion exchange ligands at or close to the exterior surface of Q HyperZ, and replace them with polar oxygen containing functions (â€°Ã›Âªplasma etching and oxidationâ€°Ã›Âª); or (ii) bury the same surface exposed ligands beneath thin polymer coatings (â€°Ã›Âªplasma polymerization coatingâ€°Ã›Âª) using appropriate monomers (vinyl acetate, vinyl pyrrolidone, safrole) and argon as the carrier gas. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (first approximately 10 nm depth) of Q HyperZ before and after the various plasma treatments confirmed that substantial changes to the elemental composition of Q HyperZâ€°Ã›Âªs exterior had been inflicted in all cases. The atomic percent changes in carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, yttrium and zirconium observed after being exposed to air plasma etching were entirely consistent with: the removal of pendant Q (trimethylammonium) functions; increased exposure of the underlying yttrium-stabilised zirconia shell; and introduction of hydroxyl and carbonyl functions. Following plasma polymerization treatments (with all three monomers tested), the increased atomic percent levels of carbon and parallel drops in nitrogen, yttrium and zirconium provided clear evidence that thin polymer coats had been created at the exteriors of Q HyperZ adsorbent particles. No changes in adsorbent size and surface morphology, nor any evidence of plasma-induced damage could be discerned from scanning electron micrographs, light micrographs and measurements of particle size distributions following 3 h exposure to air (220 V; 35.8 W L(-1)) or â€°Ã›Âªvinyl acetate/argonâ€°Ã›Âª (170 V; 16.5 W L(-1)) plasmas. Losses in bulk chloride exchange capacity before and after exposure to plasmas enabled effective modification depths within hydrated Q HyperZ adsorbent particles to be calculated as 0.2-1.2 mum, depending on the conditions applied. The depth of plasma induced alteration was strongly influenced by the power input and size of the treated batch, i.e. dropping the power or increasing the batch size resulted in reduced plasma penetration and therefore shallower modification. The selectivity of â€°Ã›Âªsurface vs. coreâ€°Ã›Âª modification imparted to Q HyperZ by the various plasma treatments was evaluated in static and dynamic binding studies employing appropriate probes, i.e. plasmid DNA, sonicated calf thymus DNA and bovine serum albumin. In static binding studies performed with adsorbents that had been exposed to plasmas at the 5 g scale (25 g L(-1) of plasma reactor), the highest â€°Ã›Âªsurface/coreâ€°Ã›Âª modification selectivity was observed for Q HyperZ that had been subjected to 3 h of air plasma etching at 220 V (35.8 W L(-1)). This treatment removed approximately 53% of â€°Ã›Âªsurfaceâ€°Ã›Âª DNA binding at the expense of a 9.3% loss in â€°Ã›Âªcoreâ€°Ã›Âª protein binding. Even more impressive results were obtained in dynamic expanded bed adsorption studies conducted with Q HyperZ adsorbents that had been treated with air (220 V, 3 h) and â€°Ã›Âªvinyl acetate/argonâ€°Ã›Âª (170 V, 3 h) plasmas at 10.5 g scale (52.5 g L(-1) of plasma reactor). Following both plasma treatments: the 10% breakthrough capacities of the modified Q HyperZ adsorbents towards â€°Ã›Âªsurfaceâ€°Ã›Âª binding DNA probes dropped very significantly (30-85%); the DNA induced inter-particle cross-linking and contraction of expanded beds observed during application of sonicated DNA on native Q HyperZ was completely eradicated; but the â€°Ã›Âªcoreâ€°Ã›Âª protein binding performance remained unchanged cf. that of the native Q HyperZ starting material.",10/29/10,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,6905-16,,44,1217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this differentiation, T(H)1 and T(H)2 cells produce interferon-gamma and interleukin (IL)-4, respectively, as autocrine factors necessary for selective lineage commitment. A distinct T(H) subset, termed T(HIL-17), T(H)17 or inflammatory T(H) (T(H)i), has been recently identified as a distinct T(H) lineage mediating tissue inflammation. T(H)17 differentiation is initiated by transforming growth factor-beta and IL-6 (refs 5-7) and reinforced by IL-23 (ref. 8), in which signal transduction and activators of transcription (STAT)3 and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)-gamma mediate the lineage specification. T(H)17 cells produce IL-17, IL-17F and IL-22, all of which regulate inflammatory responses by tissue cells but have no importance in T(H)17 differentiation. Here we show that IL-21 is another cytokine highly expressed by mouse T(H)17 cells. IL-21 is induced by IL-6 in activated T cells, a process that is dependent on STAT3 but not ROR-gamma. IL-21 potently induces T(H)17 differentiation and suppresses Foxp3 expression, which requires STAT3 and ROR-gamma, which is encoded by Rorc. IL-21 deficiency impairs the generation of T(H)17 cells and results in protection against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. IL-21 is therefore an autocrine cytokine that is sufficient and necessary for T(H)17 differentiation, and serves as a target for treating inflammatory diseases.",7/26/07,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,480-3,,7152,448,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Autocrine Communication; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Group F; Helper-Inducer/*cytology/immunology/*metabolism; Inflammation/immunology/metabolism; Interleukin-6/metabolism; Interleukin-17/biosynthesis/immunology/metabolism; Interleukins/deficiency/*immunology/*metabolism; Lymphocyte Activation; Member 3; Mice; Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1; Receptors; Retinoic Acid/metabolism; STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism; Thyroid Hormone/metabolism; T-Lymphocytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this model, we have established the relationship between stem cells and polyp and tumor formation. PTEN helps govern the proliferation rate and number of ISCs and loss of PTEN results in an excess of ISCs. In PTEN-deficient mice, excess ISCs initiate de novo crypt formation and crypt fission, recapitulating crypt production in fetal and neonatal intestine. The PTEN-Akt pathway probably governs stem cell activation by helping control nuclear localization of the Wnt pathway effector beta-catenin. Akt phosphorylates beta-catenin at Ser552, resulting in a nuclear-localized form in ISCs.

Often these molecules work in concert; for example, the TLRs can stimulate the production of the proforms of the cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18, whereas certain NLRs trigger their subsequent proteolytic processing via caspase 1. Gram-negative bacteria use type III secretion systems (T3SS) to deliver virulence factors to the cytosol of host cells, where they modulate cell physiology to favor the pathogen. We show here that NLRC4/Ipaf detects the basal body rod component of the T3SS apparatus (rod protein) from S. typhimurium (PrgJ), Burkholderia pseudomallei (BsaK), Escherichia coli (EprJ and EscI), Shigella flexneri (MxiI), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PscI). These rod proteins share a sequence motif that is essential for detection by NLRC4; a similar motif is found in flagellin that is also detected by NLRC4. S. typhimurium has two T3SS: Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 (SPI1), which encodes the rod protein PrgJ, and SPI2, which encodes the rod protein SsaI. Although PrgJ is detected by NLRC4, SsaI is not, and this evasion is required for virulence in mice. The detection of a conserved component of the T3SS apparatus enables innate immune responses to virulent bacteria through a single pathway, a strategy that is divergent from that used by plants in which multiple NB-LRR proteins are used to detect T3SS effectors or their effects on cells.

Key insights into the molecular functions of specific NPC proteins have uncovered roles for these proteins in transcriptional activation and elongation, mRNA processing, as well as chromatin structure and localization.

We report the results of applying this model to simulating gene expression variability in mammalian macrophages, demonstrating a possible molecular basis for heterogeneity in macrophage signalling responses. We note that the nature of predicted transcriptional noise in macrophages is different from that in yeast and bacteria. Some molecular interactions in yeast and bacteria are thought to have evolved to minimize the effects of the high-frequency noise observed in these species.

Pattern strength was found to correlate with organism-specific features such as genome size, overall GC content, and the occurrence of known motility and chromosomal binding proteins. Given additional functional data for Escherichia coli, we found significant correlations among chromosome position dependent patterns in numerous properties, some of which are consistent with previously experimentally identified chromosome macrodomains. These results demonstrate that the large-scale organization of most sequenced genomes is significantly nonrandom, and, moreover, that this organization is likely linked to genome size, nucleotide composition, and information transfer processes.

There is a growing number of software programs and resources for selecting optimal transitions and the instrument settings used for the detection and quantification of the targeted peptides, but the exchange of this information is hindered by a lack of a standard format. We have developed a new standardized format, called TraML, for encoding transition lists and associated metadata. In addition to introducing the TraML format, we demonstrate several implementations across the community, and provide semantic validators, extensive documentation, and multiple example instances to demonstrate correctly written documents. Widespread use of TraML will facilitate the exchange of transitions, reduce time spent handling incompatible list formats, increase the reusability of previously optimized transitions, and thus accelerate the widespread adoption of targeted proteomics via selected reaction monitoring.",2012-04,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,R111 015040,,4,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify additional regulators of T cell specification, a cDNA library from mouse Pro-T cells was screened for genes that are specifically up-regulated in intrathymic T cell precursors as compared with myeloid progenitors. Over 90 genes of interest were identified, and 35 of 44 tested were confirmed to be more highly expressed in T lineage precursors relative to precursors of B and/or myeloid lineage. To a remarkable extent, however, expression of these T lineage-enriched genes, including zinc finger transcription factor, helicase, and signaling adaptor genes, was also shared by stem cells (Lin(-)Sca-1(+)Kit(+)CD27(-)) and multipotent progenitors (Lin(-)Sca-1(+)Kit(+)CD27(+)), although down-regulated in other lineages. Thus, a major fraction of these early T lineage genes are a regulatory legacy from stem cells. The few genes sharply up-regulated between multipotent progenitors and Pro-T cell stages included those encoding transcription factors Bcl11b, TCF-1 (Tcf7), and HEBalt, Notch target Deltex1, Deltex3L, Fkbp5, Eva1, and Tmem131. Like GATA3 and Deltex1, Bcl11b, Fkbp5, and Eva1 were dependent on Notch/Delta signaling for induction in fetal liver precursors, but only Bcl11b and HEBalt were up-regulated between the first two stages of intrathymic T cell development (double negative 1 and double negative 2) corresponding to T lineage specification.

Gene regulatory networks evolve to fine tune biochemical fluxes through such metabolic pathways, enabling organisms to acclimate to nutrient fluctuations in a competitive environment. Here, we demonstrate that a single TrmB family transcription factor in Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 globally coordinates functionally linked enzymes of diverse phylogeny in response to changes in carbon source availability. Specifically, during nutritional limitation, TrmB binds a cis-regulatory element to activate or repress 113 promoters of genes encoding enzymes in diverse metabolic pathways. By this mechanism, TrmB coordinates the expression of glycolysis, TCA cycle, and amino-acid biosynthesis pathways with the biosynthesis of their cognate cofactors (e.g. purine and thiamine). Notably, the TrmB-regulated metabolic network includes enzyme-coding genes that are uniquely archaeal as well as those that are conserved across all three domains of life. Simultaneous analysis of metabolic and gene regulatory network architectures suggests an ongoing process of co-evolution in which TrmB integrates the expression of metabolic enzyme-coding genes of diverse origins.",2009,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,282,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CLARITY Challenge was designed to spur convergence in methods for diagnosing genetic disease starting from clinical case history and genome sequencing data. DNA samples were obtained from three families with heritable genetic disorders and genomic sequence data were donated by sequencing platform vendors. The challenge was to analyze and interpret these data with the goals of identifying disease-causing variants and reporting the findings in a clinically useful format. Participating contestant groups were solicited broadly, and an independent panel of judges evaluated their performance. RESULTS: A total of 30 international groups were engaged. The entries reveal a general convergence of practices on most elements of the analysis and interpretation process. However, even given this commonality of approach, only two groups identified the consensus candidate variants in all disease cases, demonstrating a need for consistent fine-tuning of the generally accepted methods. There was greater diversity of the final clinical report content and in the patient consenting process, demonstrating that these areas require additional exploration and standardization. CONCLUSIONS: The CLARITY Challenge provides a comprehensive assessment of current practices for using genome sequencing to diagnose and report genetic diseases.

Immunophenotyping methods included flow cytometry, analysis of serum immunoglobulins and autoantibodies, lymphocyte stimulation, and enzymatic assays. Genetic studies included linkage analysis, targeted Sanger sequencing, and next-generation whole-genome sequencing. <b>RESULTS: </b>Cold urticaria occurred in all affected subjects. Other, variable manifestations included atopy, granulomatous rash, autoimmune thyroiditis, the presence of antinuclear antibodies, sinopulmonary infections, and common variable immunodeficiency. Levels of serum IgM and IgA and circulating natural killer cells and class-switched memory B cells were reduced. Linkage analysis showed a 7-Mb candidate interval on chromosome 16q in one family, overlapping by 3.5 Mb a disease-associated haplotype in a smaller family. This interval includes PLCG2, encoding phospholipase CÃ«_(2) (PLCÃ«_(2)), a signaling molecule expressed in B cells, natural killer cells, and mast cells. Sequencing of complementary DNA revealed heterozygous transcripts lacking exon 19 in two families and lacking exons 20 through 22 in a third family. Genomic sequencing identified three distinct in-frame deletions that cosegregated with disease. These deletions, located within a region encoding an autoinhibitory domain, result in protein products with constitutive phospholipase activity. PLCG2-expressing cells had diminished cellular signaling at 37Ã¥Â¡C but enhanced signaling at subphysiologic temperatures. <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Genomic deletions in PLCG2 cause gain of PLCÃ«_(2) function, leading to signaling abnormalities in multiple leukocyte subsets and a phenotype encompassing both excessive and deficient immune function.

However, the principles governing the differential usage and interplay of regulation at these two levels are not clear. Here, we show that the integration of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in a characteristic network motif drives efficient environment-dependent state transitions. Through phenotypic screening, systems analysis, and rigorous experimental validation, we discovered an RNase (VNG2099C) in Halobacterium salinarum that is transcriptionally co-regulated with genes of the aerobic physiologic state but acts on transcripts of the anaerobic state. Through modelling and experimentation we show that this arrangement generates an efficient state-transition switch, within which RNase-repression of a transcriptional positive autoregulation (RPAR) loop is critical for shutting down ATP-consuming active potassium uptake to conserve energy required for salinity adaptation under aerobic, high potassium, or dark conditions. Subsequently, we discovered that many Escherichia coli operons with energy-associated functions are also putatively controlled by RPAR indicating that this network motif may have evolved independently in phylogenetically distant organisms. Thus, our data suggest that interplay of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in the RPAR motif is a generalized principle for efficient environment-dependent state transitions across prokaryotes.",2014-04,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,369-82,,2,92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigate tissue-generating asymmetric divisions in a stem cell daughter within the Arabidopsis root. Spatial restriction of these divisions requires physical binding of the stem cell regulator SCARECROW (SCR) by the RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) protein. In the stem cell niche, SCR activity is counteracted by phosphorylation of RBR through a cyclinD6;1-CDK complex. This cyclin is itself under transcriptional control of SCR and its partner SHORT ROOT (SHR), creating a robust bistable circuit with either high or low SHR-SCR complex activity. Auxin biases this circuit by promoting CYCD6;1 transcription. Mathematical modeling shows that ACDs are only switched on after integration of radial and longitudinal information, determined by SHR and auxin distribution, respectively.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Applying a next generation sequencing technology, massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), we identified a total of 4535 genes that are differentially expressed between normal brain and GBM tissue. The expression changes of three up-regulated genes, CHI3L1, CHI3L2, and FOXM1, and two down-regulated genes, neurogranin and L1CAM, were confirmed by quantitative PCR. Pathway analysis revealed that TGF- beta pathway related genes were significantly up-regulated in GBM tumor samples. An integrative pathway analysis of the TGF beta signaling network identified two alternative TGF-beta signaling pathways mediated by SOX4 (sex determining region Y-box 4) and TGFBI (Transforming growth factor beta induced). Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated that SOX4 and TGFBI expression is elevated in GBM tissues compared with normal brain tissues at both the RNA and protein levels. In vitro functional studies confirmed that TGFBI and SOX4 expression is increased by TGF-beta stimulation and decreased by a specific inhibitor of TGF-beta receptor 1 kinase. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our MPSS database for GBM and normal brain tissues provides a useful resource for the scientific community. The identification of non-SMAD mediated TGF-beta signaling pathways acting through SOX4 and TGFBI (GENE ID:7045) in GBM indicates that these alternative pathways should be considered, in addition to the canonical SMAD mediated pathway, in the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting TGF-beta signaling in GBM. Finally, the construction of an extended TGF-beta signaling network with overlaid gene expression changes between GBM and normal brain extends our understanding of the biology of GBM.",2010,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e10210,,4,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon encounter with foreign Ag, dendritic cells (DCs) go through a maturation process characterized by an increase in surface expression of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules, which leads to initiation of an effective immune response in naive T cells. The innate immune response to bacterial flagellin is mediated by TLR5, which is expressed on human DCs. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether flagellin could induce DC maturation. Immature DCs were cultured in the absence or presence of flagellin and monitored for expression of cell surface maturation markers. Stimulation with flagellin induced increased surface expression of CD83, CD80, CD86, MHC class II, and the lymph node-homing chemokine receptor CCR7. Flagellin stimulated the expression of chemokines active on neutrophils (IL-8/CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)8, GRO-alpha/CXCL1, GRO-beta/CXCL2, GRO-gamma/CXCL3), monocytes (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1/CC chemokine ligand (CCL)2), and immature DCs (macrophage-inflammatory protein-1 alpha/CCL3, macrophage-inflammatory protein-1 beta/CCL4), but not chemokines active on effector T cells (IFN-inducible protein-10 kDa/CXCL10, monokine induced by IFN-gamma/CXCL9, IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant/CXCL11). However, stimulating DCs with both flagellin and IFN-inducible protein-10 kDa, monokine induced by IFN-gamma, and IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant expression, whereas stimulation with IFN-beta or flagellin alone failed to induce these chemokines. In functional assays, flagellin-matured DCs displayed enhanced T cell stimulatory activity with a concomitant decrease in endocytic activity. Finally, DCs isolated from mouse spleens or bone marrows were shown to not express TLR5 and were not responsive to flagellin stimulation. These results demonstrate that flagellin can directly stimulate human but not murine DC maturation, providing an additional mechanism by which motile bacteria can initiate an acquired immune response.",5/15/03,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,5165-75,,10,170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adjuvants; Animals; Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology; Cells; Cell Surface/*physiology; Chemokine CXCL9; Chemokine CXCL10; Chemokine CXCL11; Chemokines; Chemokines/*biosynthesis/genetics; Coculture Techniques; Cultured; CXC/biosynthesis/genetics; Cytokines/biosynthesis; Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism/microbiology; Flagellin/*pharmacology; Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/immunology; Growth Substances/*pharmacology; Humans; Immunologic/*pharmacology; Immunophenotyping; Inbred C57BL; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics; Interferon Type I; Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology; Mice; Receptors; Recombinant/pharmacology; Species Specificity; Toll-Like Receptor 5; Toll-Like Receptors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a comparative analysis of miRNAs and their respective gene targets across four plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana (Ath), Medicago truncatula(Mtr), Brassica napus (Bna), and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cre). <b>RESULTS: </b>miRNAs were obtained from mirBase with 218 miRNAs for Ath, 375 for Mtr, 46 for Bna, and 73 for Cre, annotated for each species respectively. miRNA targets were obtained from available database annotations, bioinformatic predictions using RNAhybrid as well as predicted from an analysis of mRNA degradation products (degradome sequencing) aimed at identifying miRNA cleavage products. On average, and considering both experimental and bioinformatic predictions together, every miRNA was associated with about 46 unique gene transcripts with considerably variation across species. We observed a positive and linear correlation between the number miRNAs and the total number of transcripts across different plant species suggesting that the repertoire of miRNAs correlates with the size of the transcriptome of an organism. Conserved miRNA-target pairs were found to be associated with developmental processes and transcriptional regulation, while species-specific (in particular, Ath) pairs are involved in signal transduction and response to stress processes. Conserved miRNAs have more targets and higher expression values than non-conserved miRNAs. We found evidence for a conservation of not only the sequence of miRNAs, but their expression levels as well. <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Our results support the notion of a high birth and death rate of miRNAs and that miRNAs serve many species specific functions, while conserved miRNA are related mainly to developmental processes and transcriptional regulation with conservation operating at both the sequence and expression level.",2011,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,483,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A similar database was created for analysis of neutral loss at the carboxy termini using a data set of chymotryptic peptides. The analysis demonstrated that the presence of an internal basic residue, limiting proton mobility, has a profound effect on neutral loss. Peptides with fully mobile protons demonstrated minimal neutral loss, with the exception of amide bonds with proline on the carboxy terminal side, which created an intense neutral loss peak. In contrast, peptides with partial proton mobility contained many amino acids on either side of the amide bond associated with a strong neutral loss peak. Most notable among these was proline on the carboxy terminal side of an amide bond and aspartic acid on the amino terminal side of a bond. All results were found to be consistent for doubly and triply charged peptides and after adjustment for pairings across the amide bonds with particularly labile residues.

In addition to photoreactivation, three other putative repair mechanisms were identified including d(CTAG) methylation-directed mismatch repair, four oxidative damage repair enzymes, and two proteases for eliminating damaged proteins. Moreover, a UV-induced down-regulation of many important metabolic functions was observed during light repair and seems to be a phenomenon shared by all three domains of life. The systems analysis has facilitated the assignment of putative functions to 26 of 33 key proteins in the UV response through sequence-based methods and/or similarities of their predicted three-dimensional structures to known structures in the PDB. Finally, the systems analysis has raised, through the integration of experimentally determined and computationally inferred data, many experimentally testable hypotheses that describe the metabolic and regulatory networks of Halobacterium NRC-1.",2004-06,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,1025-35,,6,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Archaeal/genetics; Archaeal/genetics/radiation effects; Archaeal Proteins/physiology; Cricetinae; Deoxyribodipyrimidine Photo-Lyase/deficiency; DNA Repair/genetics; Gene Expression Profiling/methods; Gene Expression Regulation; Halobacterium/classification/enzymology/*genetics/*radiation effects; Light; Mesocricetus/genetics; Messenger/genetics; Mice; Mutation/genetics; Nucleic Acid; Repressor Proteins/genetics; RNA; Sequence Homology; Survival Rate; Time Factors; Transcription Factors/genetics; Ultraviolet Rays,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason, we have developed a platform that uses automated image analysis and pattern recognition to quantify phenotypic signatures of yeast colonies. Our strategy enables quantitative analysis of individual colonies, measured at a single time point or over a series of time-lapse images, as well as the classification of distinct colony shapes based on image-derived features. Phenotypic changes in colony morphology can be expressed as changes in feature space trajectories over time, thereby enabling the visualization and quantitative analysis of morphological development.

Current efforts to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) focus primarily on proximal data such as gene co-expression and transcription factor (TF) binding. While such approaches enable rapid reconstruction of TRNs, the overwhelming combinatorics of possible networks limits identification of mechanistic regulatory interactions. Utilizing growth phenotypes and systems-level constraints to inform regulatory network reconstruction is an unmet challenge. We present our approach Gene Expression and Metabolism Integrated for Network Inference (GEMINI) that links a compendium of candidate regulatory interactions with the metabolic network to predict their systems-level effect on growth phenotypes. We then compare predictions with experimental phenotype data to select phenotype-consistent regulatory interactions. GEMINI makes use of the observation that only a small fraction of regulatory network states are compatible with a viable metabolic network, and outputs a regulatory network that is simultaneously consistent with the input genome-scale metabolic network model, gene expression data, and TF knockout phenotypes. GEMINI preferentially recalls gold-standard interactions (p-value = 10(-172)), significantly better than using gene expression alone. We applied GEMINI to create an integrated metabolic-regulatory network model for Saccharomyces cerevisiae involving 25,000 regulatory interactions controlling 1597 metabolic reactions. The model quantitatively predicts TF knockout phenotypes in new conditions (p-value = 10(-14)) and revealed potential condition-specific regulatory mechanisms. Our results suggest that a metabolic constraint-based approach can be successfully used to help reconstruct TRNs from high-throughput data, and highlights the potential of using a biochemically-detailed mechanistic framework to integrate and reconcile inconsistencies across different data-types.

Extreme pathway analysis is a useful method for analyzing the phenotypic capabilities of these networks. Many extreme pathways are needed to fully describe the functional capabilities of genome-scale metabolic networks, and therefore, a need exists to develop methods to study these large sets of extreme pathways. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of matrices of extreme pathways was used to develop a conceptual framework for the interpretation of large sets of extreme pathways and the steady-state flux solution space they define. The key results of this study were: 1), convex steady-state solution cones describing the potential functions of biochemical networks can be studied using the modes generated by SVD; 2), Helicobacter pylori has a more rigid metabolic network (i.e., a lower dimensional solution space and a more dominant first singular value) than Haemophilus influenzae for the production of amino acids; and 3), SVD allows for direct comparison of different solution cones resulting from the production of different amino acids. SVD was used to identify key network branch points that may identify key control points for regulation.

To cope with such external variability, the global dynamics of the genetic network must possess two central properties. (a) It must be robust enough as to guarantee stability under a broad range of external conditions, and (b) it must be flexible enough to recognize and integrate specific external signals that may help the organism to change and adapt to different environments. This compromise between robustness and adaptability has been observed in dynamical systems operating at the brink of a phase transition between order and chaos. Such systems are termed critical. Thus, criticality, a precise, measurable, and well characterized property of dynamical systems, makes it possible for robustness and adaptability to coexist in living organisms. In this work we investigate the dynamical properties of the gene transcription networks reported for S. cerevisiae, E. coli, and B. subtilis, as well as the network of segment polarity genes of D. melanogaster, and the network of flower development of A. thaliana. We use hundreds of microarray experiments to infer the nature of the regulatory interactions among genes, and implement these data into the Boolean models of the genetic networks.

ChIP products were then used to screen custom genomic tiling arrays of putative Hedgehog (Hh) targets predicted from transcriptional profiling studies, surveying 50-150 kb of non-transcribed sequence for each candidate. In addition to identifying expected Gli-target sites, the data predicted a number of unreported direct targets of Shh action. Transgenic analysis of binding regions in Nkx2.2, Nkx2.1 (Titf1) and Rab34 established these as direct Hh targets.

Recent screening studies have begun to catalogue ISGs with antiviral activity against several RNA and DNA viruses. However, antiviral ISG specificity across multiple distinct classes of viruses remains largely unexplored. Here we used an ectopic expression assay to screen a library of more than 350 human ISGs for effects on 14 viruses representing 7 families and 11 genera. We show that 47 genes inhibit one or more viruses, and 25 genes enhance virus infectivity. Comparative analysis reveals that the screened ISGs target positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses more effectively than negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Gene clustering highlights the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS, also known as MB21D1) as a gene whose expression also broadly inhibits several RNA viruses. In vitro, lentiviral delivery of enzymatically active cGAS triggers a STING-dependent, IRF3-mediated antiviral program that functions independently of canonical IFN/STAT1 signalling. In vivo, genetic ablation of murine cGAS reveals its requirement in the antiviral response to two DNA viruses, and an unappreciated contribution to the innate control of an RNA virus.

The model of the network is in a continuous process of revision and growth as new genes are added and new experimental results become available; see http://www.its.caltech.edu/ mirsky/endomeso.htm (End-mes Gene Network Update) for the latest version. The network contains over 40 genes at present, many newly uncovered in the course of this work, and most encoding DNA-binding transcriptional regulatory factors. The architecture of the network was approached initially by construction of a logic model that integrated the extensive experimental evidence now available on endomesoderm specification. The internal linkages between genes in the network have been determined functionally, by measurement of the effects of regulatory perturbations on the expression of all relevant genes in the network. Five kinds of perturbation have been applied: (1) use of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides targeted to many of the key regulatory genes in the network; (2) transformation of other regulatory factors into dominant repressors by construction of Engrailed repressor domain fusions; (3) ectopic expression of given regulatory factors, from genetic expression constructs and from injected mRNAs; (4) blockade of the beta-catenin/Tcf pathway by introduction of mRNA encoding the intracellular domain of cadherin; and (5) blockade of the Notch signaling pathway by introduction of mRNA encoding the extracellular domain of the Notch receptor. The network model predicts the cis-regulatory inputs that link each gene into the network. Therefore, its architecture is testable by cis-regulatory analysis. Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Lytechinus variegatus genomic BAC recombinants that include a large number of the genes in the network have been sequenced and annotated. Tests of the cis-regulatory predictions of the model are greatly facilitated by interspecific computational sequence comparison, which affords a rapid identification of likely cis-regulatory elements in advance of experimental analysis. The network specifies genomically encoded regulatory processes between early cleavage and gastrula stages. These control the specification of the micromere lineage and of the initial veg(2) endomesodermal domain; the blastula-stage separation of the central veg(2) mesodermal domain (i.e., the secondary mesenchyme progenitor field) from the peripheral veg(2) endodermal domain; the stabilization of specification state within these domains; and activation of some downstream differentiation genes.

Here, we used a functional proteomic approach, isotope-coded affinity tagging and mass spectrometry, to identify active components of the OEC secreteome that differentially stimulate outgrowth. SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) (osteonectin) was identified as an OEC-derived matricellular protein that can indirectly enhance the ability of Schwann cells to stimulate dorsal root ganglion outgrowth in vitro. SPARC stimulates Schwann cell-mediated outgrowth by cooperative signal with laminin-1 and transforming growth factor beta. Furthermore, when SPARC-null OECs were transplanted into lesioned rat spinal cord, the absence of OEC-secreted SPARC results in an attenuation of outgrowth of specific subsets of sensory and supraspinal axons and changes the pattern of macrophage infiltration in response to the transplanted cells. These data provide the first evidence for a role for SPARC in modulating different aspects of CNS repair and indicate that SPARC can change the activation state of endogenous Schwann cells, resulting in the promotion of outgrowth in vitro, and in vivo.",7/4/07,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,7208-21,,27,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Cattle; Humans; Inbred C57BL; Knockout; Mice; Neurites/drug effects/*physiology; Olfactory Bulb/cytology/*secretion/transplantation; Osteonectin/*secretion/therapeutic use; Rats; Schwann Cells/drug effects/*physiology; Spinal Cord Injuries/metabolism/*therapy; Sprague-Dawley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Post-experimental refinement of the counting script resulted in one counting error in 2694 images of beads (99.96% accuracy). We analyzed a range of operational variables (flow pressure, bead concentration, etc.) using a statistical model to characterize those that yielded optimal sorting speed and efficiency. The integrated device was able to capture, count, and deliver beads at a rate of approximately four per minute so that bead arrays could be assembled in 32 individually addressable assay chambers for eight analytical measurements in duplicate (512 beads total) within 2.5 hours.

With careful analysis of sequence error statistics and other controls, we demonstrated that there is a wide range of RNA from many different organisms, including bacteria and fungi as well as from other species. These RNAs may be associated with protein, lipid or other molecules protecting them from RNase activity in plasma. Some of these RNAs are detected in intracellular complexes and may be able to influence cellular activities under invitro conditions.

In this study, we demonstrate that these bacteria make flagellin molecules that are not recognized by TLR5. We map the site responsible for TLR5 evasion to amino acids 89-96 of the N-terminal D1 domain, which is centrally positioned within the previously defined TLR5 recognition site. Salmonella flagellin is strongly recognized by TLR5, but mutating residues 89-96 to the corresponding H. pylori flaA sequence abolishes TLR5 recognition and also destroys bacterial motility. To preserve bacterial motility, alpha and epsilon Proteobacteria possess compensatory amino acid changes in other regions of the flagellin molecule, and we engineer a mutant form of Salmonella flagellin that evades TLR5 but retains motility. These results suggest that TLR5 evasion is critical for the survival of this subset of bacteria at mucosal sites in animals and raise the intriguing possibility that flagellin receptors provided the selective force to drive the evolution of these unique subclasses of bacterial flagellins.",6/28/05,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,9247-52,,26,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Bacteria/*metabolism; Bartonella/metabolism; Binding Sites; Campylobacter/metabolism; Cell Surface/*metabolism; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; Dose-Response Relationship; Drug; Evolution; Flagella/*metabolism; Flagellin/chemistry; Helicobacter pylori/metabolism; Humans; Immunity; Immunoblotting; Innate; Luciferases/metabolism; Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism; Models; Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; NF-kappa B/metabolism; Phylogeny; Protein Binding; Protein Structure; Proteobacteria/metabolism; Receptors; Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry; Salmonella/metabolism; Sequence Homology; Software; Tertiary; Toll-Like Receptor 5; Toll-Like Receptors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each iteration consists of sequencing a novel portion of target DNA that does not overlap any previously sequenced region. Subject to the constraint of no overlap, each new region is chosen randomly. A parking strategy is often ideal in the early stages of a project for rapidly generating unique data. As a project progresses, parking becomes progressively more expensive and eventually prohibitive. We present a mathematical model with a generalization to allow for overlaps. This model predicts multiple parameters, including progress, costs, and the distribution of gap sizes left by a parking strategy. The highly fragmented nature of the gaps left after an initial parking strategy may make it difficult to finish a project efficiently. Therefore, in addition to our parking model, we model gap closing by walking. Our gap-closing model is generalizable to many other strategies. Our discussion includes modified parking strategies and hybrids with other strategies.

We evaluated if high levels of autoantibodies against the 65 kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65Ab), were associated with high-risk genes, i.e. HLA, CTLA-4 and INS VNTR genes. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Seventy-five (M/F 39/36) subjects exceeding the 95th percentile of GAD65 autoantibody index and 75 age and sex matched subjects below the 95th percentile, randomly selected amongst participants in the Vasterbotten Intervention Programme. METHODS: The GAD65 Ab were measured in a radioligand-binding assay. HLA class II typing was performed by an oligoblot hybridization method. CTLA-4 repeat length was analysed and divided into short forms and long forms. Class I and class III alleles of INS VNTR were detected. Differences in distribution were tested by Pearson chi-square with Yates correction. Odds ratios (OR) were used to compare groups calculated with Cochranâ€°Ã›Âªs and Mantel-Haenszel statistics. RESULTS: The DQB1*0201-DQA1*0501-DRB1*03 haplotype was increased in subjects with high GAD65Ab levels (P = 0.04). This increase seemed to be explained by a difference in haplotype frequencies amongst men (P = 0.01). Calculating OR showed a significant association between the DQB1*0201-DQA1*0501-DRB1*03 haplotype and elevated levels of GAD65Ab in all subjects (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.02-4.9) as well as in men (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.3-15.9). There was no association between high levels of GAD65Ab and either INS VNTR or CTLA-4 polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that adult males with the DQB1*0201-DQA1*0501-DRB1*03 haplotype tend to develop high GAD65Ab titres. As none of these subjects have developed diabetes these data suggest that HLA may be important in GAD65Ab formation but that additional factors are required for the progression to overt type 1 diabetes.",2003-04,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,447-53,,4,253,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Immunoconjugates; Adult; Antigens; Autoantibodies/*blood; CD; Diabetes Mellitus; Differentiation/*blood; Female; Glutamate Decarboxylase/*immunology; HLA-DQ Antigens/*genetics/physiology; Humans; Insulin/*genetics; Male; Middle Aged; Minisatellite Repeats; Odds Ratio; Radioligand Assay/methods; Type 1/diagnosis/genetics/immunology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most epileptic encephalopathies have a genetic cause and patients are often found to carry a heterozygous de novo mutation in one of the genes associated with the disease entity. Occasionally recessive mutations are identified: a recent publication described a distinct neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (MIM 615905) caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the SLC13A5 gene. Here, we report eight additional patients belonging to four different families with autosomal recessive mutations in SLC13A5. SLC13A5 encodes a high affinity sodium-dependent citrate transporter, which is expressed in the brain. Neurons are considered incapable of de novo synthesis of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates; therefore they rely on the uptake of intermediates, such as citrate, to maintain their energy status and neurotransmitter production. The effect of all seven identified mutations (two premature stops and five amino acid substitutions) was studied in vitro, using immunocytochemistry, selective western blot and mass spectrometry.

The genome is organized into nine circular replicons of varying G+C compositions ranging from 54% to 62%. Comparison of the genome architectures of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and H. marismortui suggests a common ancestor for the two organisms and a genome of significantly reduced size in the former. Both of these halophilic archaea use the same strategy of high surface negative charge of folded proteins as means to circumvent the salting-out phenomenon in a hypersaline cytoplasm. A multitiered annotation approach, including primary sequence similarities, protein family signatures, structure prediction, and a protein function association network, has assigned putative functions for at least 58% of the 4242 predicted proteins, a far larger number than is usually achieved in most newly sequenced microorganisms. Among these assigned functions were genes encoding six opsins, 19 MCP and/or HAMP domain signal transducers, and an unusually large number of environmental response regulators-nearly five times as many as those encoded in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1â€°Ã›Ã’suggesting H. marismortui is significantly more physiologically capable of exploiting diverse environments. In comparing the physiologies of the two halophilic archaea, in addition to the expected extensive similarity, we discovered several differences in their metabolic strategies and physiological responses such as distinct pathways for arginine breakdown in each halophile. Finally, as expected from the larger genome, H. marismortui encodes many more functions and seems to have fewer nutritional requirements for survival than does Halobacterium sp.

These networks have been manually curated based on legacy data and elementally and charge balanced. Comparative analysis of these well curated networks is now possible. Pairs of metabolites often appear together in several network reactions, linking them topologically. This co-occurrence of pairs of metabolites in metabolic reactions is termed herein ""metabolite coupling."" These metabolite pairs can be directly computed from the stoichiometric matrix, S. Metabolite coupling is derived from the matrix ssT, whose off-diagonal elements indicate the number of reactions in which any two metabolites participate together, where s is the binary form of S. RESULTS: Metabolite coupling in the studied networks was found to be dominated by a relatively small group of highly interacting pairs of metabolites. As would be expected, metabolites with high individual metabolite connectivity also tended to be those with the highest metabolite coupling, as the most connected metabolites couple more often. For metabolite pairs that are not highly coupled, we show that the number of reactions a pair of metabolites shares across a metabolic network closely approximates a line on a log-log scale. We also show that the preferential coupling of two metabolites with each other is spread across the spectrum of metabolites and is not unique to the most connected metabolites. We provide a measure for determining which metabolite pairs couple more often than would be expected based on their individual connectivity in the network and show that these metabolites often derive their principal biological functions from existing in pairs. Thus, analysis of metabolite coupling provides information beyond that which is found from studying the individual connectivity of individual metabolites. CONCLUSION: The coupling of metabolites is an important topological property of metabolic networks. By computing coupling quantitatively for the first time in genome-scale metabolic networks, we provide insight into the basic structure of these networks.",2006,2/8/16 23:58,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,7,,BMC Bioinformatics,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,"*Models, Biological; Chromosome Mapping/*methods; Computer Simulation; Models, Chemical; Protein Interaction Mapping/*methods; Proteome/*metabolism; Signal Transduction/*physiology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diatoms rely on energetically expensive carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) to fix carbon efficiently at modern levels of CO2 (refs 3, 4, 5). How diatoms may respond over the short and long term to rising atmospheric CO2 remains an open question. Here we use nitrate-limited chemostats to show that the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana rapidly responds to increasing CO2 by differentially expressing gene clusters that regulate transcription and chromosome folding, and subsequently reduces transcription of photosynthesis and respiration gene clusters under steady-state elevated CO2. These results suggest that exposure to elevated CO2 first causes a shift in regulation, and then a metabolic rearrangement. Genes in one CO2-responsive cluster included CCM and photorespiration genes that share a putative cAMP-responsive cis-regulatory sequence, implying these genes are co-regulated in response to CO2, with cAMP as an intermediate messenger. We verified cAMP-induced downregulation of CCM gene Ã«Â«-CA3 in nutrient-replete diatom cultures by inhibiting the hydrolysis of cAMP.

The peroxin Pex19p has been proposed to be either the receptor that recognizes and targets newly synthesized peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMP) to the peroxisome or a chaperone required for stabilization of PMPs at the peroxisomal membrane. Differentiating between these two roles for Pex19p could be achieved by determining whether the peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS) and the region of Pex19p binding of a PMP are the same or different. We addressed the role for Pex19p in the assembly of two PMPs, Pex30p and Pex32p, of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pex30p and Pex32p control peroxisome size and number but are dispensable for peroxisome formation. Systematic truncations from the carboxyl terminus, together with in-frame deletions of specific regions, have identified PTSs essential for targeting Pex30p and Pex32p to peroxisomes. Both Pex30p and Pex32p interact with Pex19p in regions that do not overlap with their PTSs. However, Pex19p is required for localizing Pex30p and Pex32p to peroxisomes, because mutations that disrupt the interaction of Pex19p with Pex30p and Pex32p lead to their mislocalization to a compartment other than peroxisomes. Mutants of Pex30p and Pex32p that localize to peroxisomes but produce cells exhibiting the peroxisomal phenotypes of cells lacking these proteins demonstrate that the regions in these proteins that control peroxisomal targeting and cell biological activity are separable. Together, our data show that the interaction of Pex19p with Pex30p and Pex32p is required for their roles in peroxisome biogenesis and are consistent with a chaperone role for Pex19p in stabilizing or maintaining membrane proteins in peroxisomes.",5/26/06,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,14805-12,,21,281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cell Membrane/metabolism; Confocal; Gene Deletion; Genotype; Membrane Proteins/*chemistry/*physiology; Microscopy; Mutation; Peroxisomes/metabolism; Phenotype; Protein Binding; Protein Structure; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/*chemistry/*physiology; Subcellular Fractions; Tertiary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The test was carried out on the otx gene of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. This gene plays a major role in the gene regulatory network that underlies endomesoderm specification in the embryo. The cis-regulatory organization of the otx gene is expected to be complex, because the gene has three different start sites (X. Li, C.-K. Chuang, C.-A. Mao, L. M. Angerer, and W. H. Klein, 1997, Dev. Biol. 187, 253-266), and it is expressed in many different spatial domains of the embryo. BAC recombinants containing the otx gene were isolated from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Lytechinus variegatus libraries, and the ordered sequence of these BACs was obtained and annotated. Sixty kilobases of DNA flanking the gene, and included in the BAC sequence from both species, were scanned computationally for short conserved sequence elements. For this purpose, we used a newly constructed software package assembled in our laboratory, ""FamilyRelations."" This tool allows detection of sequence similarities above a chosen criterion within sliding windows set at 20-50 bp. Seventeen partially conserved regions, most a few hundred base pairs long, were amplified from the S. purpuratus BAC DNA by PCR, inserted in an expression vector driving a CAT reporter, and tested for cis-regulatory activity by injection into fertilized S. purpuratus eggs. The regulatory activity of these constructs was assessed by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WMISH) using a probe against CAT mRNA. Of the 17 constructs, 11 constructs displayed spatially restricted regulatory activity, and 6 were inactive in this test. The domains within which the cis-regulatory constructs were expressed are approximately consistent with results from a WMISH study on otx expression in the embryo, in which we used probes specific for the mRNAs generated from each of the three transcription start sites. Four separate cis-regulatory elements that specifically produce endomesodermal expression were identified, as well as ubiquitously active elements, and ectoderm-specific elements. We confirm predictions from other work with respect to target sites for specific transcription factors within the elements that express in the endoderm.",6/1/02,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,148-61,,1,246,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Regulatory Sequences; Animals; Artificial; Bacterial; Chromosomes; DNA; Genetic Vectors; In Situ Hybridization; Nucleic Acid; Sea Urchins/*embryology/genetics; Species Specificity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two frequently used large-scale modeling frameworks are Bayesian networks (BNs) and Boolean networks, the latter one being a special case of its recent stochastic extension, probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs). PBN is a promising model class that generalizes the standard rule-based interactions of Boolean networks into the stochastic setting. Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) is a general and versatile model class that is able to represent complex temporal stochastic processes and has also been proposed as a model for gene regulatory systems. In this paper, we concentrate on these two model classes and demonstrate that PBNs and a certain subclass of DBNs can represent the same joint probability distribution over their common variables. The major benefit of introducing the relationships between the models is that it opens up the possibility of applying the standard tools of DBNs to PBNs and vice versa. Hence, the standard learning tools of DBNs can be applied in the context of PBNs, and the inference methods give a natural way of handling the missing values in PBNs which are often present in gene expression measurements. Conversely, the tools for controlling the stationary behavior of the networks, tools for projecting networks onto sub-networks, and efficient learning schemes can be used for DBNs. In other words, the introduced relationships between the models extend the collection of analysis tools for both model classes.",2006-04,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,814-834,,4,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand and improve the biochemical pathway to solvents, the development of genetic tools for engineering C. beijerinckii is highly desired. Based on mobile group II intron technology, a targetron gene knockout system was developed for C. beijerinckii in this study. This system was successfully employed to disrupt acid production pathways in C. beijerinckii, leading to pta (encoding phosphotransacetylase)- and buk (encoding butyrate kinase)-negative mutants. In addition to experimental characterization, the mutant phenotypes were analyzed in the context of our C. beijerinckii genome-scale model. Compared to those of the parental strain (C. beijerinckii 8052), acetate production in the pta mutant was substantially reduced and butyrate production was remarkably increased, while solvent production was dependent on the growth medium. The pta mutant also produced much higher levels of lactate, suggesting that disrupting pta influenced the energy generation and electron flow pathways.

Using quantitative proteomics, KLF3 was identified as one of several candidate factors that recognize the MPEX control element in the Muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that KLF3 is enriched at many muscle gene promoters (MCK, Myosin heavy chain IIa, Six4, Calcium channel receptor alpha-1, and Skeletal alpha-actin), and two KLF3 isoforms are upregulated during muscle differentiation. KLF3 and SRF physically associate and synergize in transactivating the MCK promoter independently of SRF binding to CArG motifs. The zinc finger and repression domains of KLF3 plus the MADS box and transcription activation domain of SRF are implicated in this synergy. Our results provide the first evidence of a role for KLF3 in muscle gene regulation and reveal an alternate mechanism for transcriptional regulation by SRF via its recruitment to KLF binding sites. Since both factors are expressed in all muscle lineages, SRF may regulate many striated- and smooth-muscle genes that lack known SRF control elements, thus further expanding the breadth of the emerging CArGome.",2010-07,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,3430-43,,14,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Binding Sites/genetics; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Creatine Kinase; DNA Primers/genetics; Genetic; Humans; Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism; Mice; MM Form/genetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Myoblasts; Promoter Regions; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Proteomics; Serum Response Factor/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism; Skeletal/cytology/*metabolism; Transcriptional Activation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Type 1 interferons (IFN-I) are crucial mediators of antiviral responses and their transcription is regulated by a variety of transcription factors; principal among these is the family of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). The IRF gene regulatory networks are complex and contain multiple feedback loops. The tools of systems biology are well suited to elucidate the complex interactions that give rise to precise coordination of the interferon response. Here we have used an unbiased systems approach to predict that a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, FOXO3, is a negative regulator of a subset of antiviral genes. This prediction was validated using macrophages isolated from Foxo3-null mice. Genome-wide location analysis combined with gene deletion studies identified the Irf7 gene as a critical target of FOXO3. FOXO3 was identified as a negative regulator of Irf7 transcription and we have further demonstrated that FOXO3, IRF7 and IFN-I form a coherent feed-forward regulatory circuit. Our data suggest that the FOXO3-IRF7 regulatory circuit represents a novel mechanism for establishing the requisite set points in the interferon pathway that balances the beneficial effects and deleterious sequelae of the antiviral response.",9/16/12,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One widely cited reason is lack of classification consistency, largely due to failure to maintain performance from study to study. This failure is widely attributed to variability in data collected for the same phenotype among disparate studies, due to technical factors unrelated to phenotypes (e.g., laboratory settings resulting in ""batch-effects"") and non-phenotype-associated biological variation in the underlying populations. These sources of variability persist in new data collection technologies. METHODS: Here we quantify the impact of these combined ""study-effects"" on a disease signature's predictive performance by comparing two types of validation methods: ordinary randomized cross-validation (RCV), which extracts random subsets of samples for testing, and inter-study validation (ISV), which excludes an entire study for testing. Whereas RCV hardwires an assumption of training and testing on identically distributed data, this key property is lost in ISV, yielding systematic decreases in performance estimates relative to RCV. Measuring the RCV-ISV difference as a function of number of studies quantifies influence of study-effects on performance. RESULTS: As a case study, we gathered publicly available gene expression data from 1,470 microarray samples of 6 lung phenotypes from 26 independent experimental studies and 769 RNA-seq samples of 2 lung phenotypes from 4 independent studies. We find that the RCV-ISV performance discrepancy is greater in phenotypes with few studies, and that the ISV performance converges toward RCV performance as data from additional studies are incorporated into classification. CONCLUSIONS: We show that by examining how fast ISV performance approaches RCV as the number of studies is increased, one can estimate when ""sufficient"" diversity has been achieved for learning a molecular signature likely to translate without significant loss of accuracy to new clinical settings.",2014,2/8/16 23:58,2/9/16 0:19,,,,10,9,,PLoS One,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many genomes contain a large fraction of repetitive DNA, much of which is made up of remnants of transposable elements (TEs). Accurate annotation of TEs enables research into their biology and can shed light on the evolutionary processes that shape genomes. Identification and masking of TEs can also greatly simplify many downstream genome annotation and sequence analysis tasks. The commonly used TE annotation tools RepeatMasker and Censor depend on sequence homology search tools such as cross_match and BLAST variants, as well as Repbase, a collection of known TE families each represented by a single consensus sequence. Dfam contains entries corresponding to all Repbase TE entries for which instances have been found in the human genome. Each Dfam entry is represented by a profile hidden Markov model, built from alignments generated using RepeatMasker and Repbase. When used in conjunction with the hidden Markov model search tool nhmmer, Dfam produces a 2.9% increase in coverage over consensus sequence search methods on a large human benchmark, while maintaining low false discovery rates, and coverage of the full human genome is 54.5%.

Though recent studies have demonstrated the power of using gene modules to shed light on the functioning of complex biological systems, most modules in these networks have shown little association with meaningful biological function. We have devised a method which directly incorporates gene ontology (GO) annotation in construction of gene modules in order to gain better functional association. RESULTS: We have devised a method, Semantic Similarity-Integrated approach for Modularization (SSIM) that integrates various gene-gene pairwise similarity values, including information obtained from gene expression, protein-protein interactions and GO annotations, in the construction of modules using affinity propagation clustering. We demonstrated the performance of the proposed method using data from two complex biological responses: 1. the osmotic shock response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and 2. the prion-induced pathogenic mouse model. In comparison with two previously reported algorithms, modules identified by SSIM showed significantly stronger association with biological functions. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of semantic similarity based on GO annotation with gene expression and protein-protein interaction data can greatly enhance the functional relevance of inferred gene modules. In addition, the SSIM approach can also reveal the hierarchical structure of gene modules to gain a broader functional view of the biological system. Hence, the proposed method can facilitate comprehensive and in-depth analysis of high throughput experimental data at the gene network level.",7/26/11,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,117,,1,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, in an attempt to characterize unique and shared responses to chemically similar metals, we have reconstructed physiological behaviors of Halobacterium NRC-1, an archaeal halophile, in sublethal levels of Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II). Over 20% of all genes responded transiently within minutes of exposure to Fe(II), perhaps reflecting immediate large-scale physiological adjustments to maintain homeostasis. At steady state, each transition metal induced growth arrest, attempts to minimize oxidative stress, toxic ion scavenging, increased protein turnover and DNA repair, and modulation of active ion transport. While several of these constitute generalized stress responses, up-regulation of active efflux of Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II), down-regulation of Mn(II) uptake and up-regulation of Fe(II) chelation, confer resistance to the respective metals. We have synthesized all of these discoveries into a unified systems-level model to provide an integrated perspective of responses to six transition metals with emphasis on experimentally verified regulatory mechanisms. Finally, through comparisons across global transcriptional responses to different metals, we provide insights into putative in vivo metal selectivity of metalloregulatory proteins and demonstrate that a systems approach can help rapidly unravel novel metabolic potential and regulatory programs of poorly studied organisms.",6/2/06,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,841-854,,,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In agreement with previous reports based on a small number of ORs, we find that humans have a significantly higher proportion of OR pseudogenes than chimpanzees. Moreover, we can reject the possibility that humans have been accumulating OR pseudogenes at a constant neutral rate since the divergence of human and chimpanzee. The comparison of the two repertoires reveals two chimpanzee-specific OR subfamily expansions and three expansions specific to humans. It also suggests that a subset of OR genes are under positive selection in either the human or the chimpanzee lineage. Thus, although overall there is relaxed constraint on human olfaction relative to chimpanzee, species-specific sensory requirements appear to have shaped the evolution of the functional OR gene repertoires in both species.",2005-02,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,224-30,,2,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Evolution; Genes/genetics; Genetic; Humans; Molecular; Odorant/*genetics; Pan troglodytes/*genetics; Phylogeny; Pseudogenes/genetics; Receptors; Selection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TLRs and the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) are prototypic pattern recognition receptors that detect extracellular and cytosolic pathogens, respectively. Listeria monocytogenes has both extracellular and cytosolic phases and is detected in the cytosol by members of the NLR family. These include two NLR members, NLRC4 and NLRP3, that, upon detection of cytosolic L. monocytogenes, induce the assembly of the inflammasome. Inflammasomes serve as platforms for the activation of the protease caspase 1, which mediates the processing and secretion of pro-IL-1beta and pro-IL-18. We previously provided evidence that L. monocytogenes is also detected by a third inflammasome. We now use biochemical and genetic approaches to demonstrate that the third detector senses bacterial DNA and identify it as Aim2, a receptor that has previously been shown to detect viral DNA.",7/15/10,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,818-21,,2,185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have identified strains that are able to reversibly toggle between the fluffy and smooth colony-forming states. Using a combination of flow cytometry and high-throughput restriction-site associated DNA tag sequencing, we show that this switch is correlated with a change in chromosomal copy number. Furthermore, the gain of a single chromosome is sufficient to switch a strain from the fluffy to the smooth state, and its subsequent loss to revert the strain back to the fluffy state. Because copy number imbalance of six of the 16 S. cerevisiae chromosomes and even a single gene can modulate the switch, our results support the hypothesis that the state switch is produced by dosage-sensitive genes, rather than a general response to altered DNA content. These findings add a complex, multicellular phenotype to the list of molecular and cellular traits known to be altered by aneuploidy and suggest that chromosome missegregation can provide a quick, heritable, and reversible mechanism by which organisms can toggle between phenotypes.",7/23/13,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,12367-72,,30,110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Aneuploidy; Chromosomes; Fungal; Gene Dosage; Phenotype; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we inferred a transcriptional network underlying TLR-stimulated murine macrophage activation.

Patients may undergo immunological changes known as ""reactional states"" (reversal reaction and erythema nodosum leprosum) that result in major clinical deterioration. The goal of the present study was to assess the effect of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) polymorphisms on susceptibility to and clinical presentation of leprosy. METHODS: Three polymorphisms in TLR2 (597Câ€°Ã›Ã’>T, 1350Tâ€°Ã›Ã’>C, and a microsatellite marker) were analyzed in 431 Ethiopian patients with leprosy and 187 control subjects. The polymorphism-associated risk of developing leprosy, lepromatous (vs. tuberculoid) leprosy, and leprosy reactions was assessed by multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: The microsatellite and the 597Câ€°Ã›Ã’>T polymorphisms both influenced susceptibility to reversal reaction. Although the 597T allele had a protective effect (odds ratio [OR], 0.34 [95% confidence interval CI, 0.17-0.68]; P= .002 under the dominant model), homozygosity for the 280-bp allelic length of the microsatellite strongly increased the risk of reversal reaction (OR, 5.83 [95% CI, 1.98-17.15]; P= .001 under the recessive model). These associations were consistent among 3 different ethnic groups.

Here, we report the mechanism of the autoregulation of Rhp26, which is the homolog of CSB/ERCC6 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We identified a novel conserved protein motif, termed the ""leucine latch,"" at the N terminus of Rhp26. The leucine latch motif mediates the autoinhibition of the ATPase and chromatin-remodeling activities of Rhp26 via its interaction with the core ATPase domain. Moreover, we found that the C terminus of the protein counteracts this autoinhibition and that both the N- and C-terminal regions of Rhp26 are needed for its proper function in DNA repair in vivo. The presence of the leucine latch motif in organisms ranging from yeast to humans suggests a conserved mechanism for the autoregulation of CSB/ERCC6 despite the otherwise highly divergent nature of the N- and C-terminal regions.",12/30/14,2/5/16 22:14,2/5/16 23:15,,18566-18571,,52,111,,Proc.

Although sample heterogeneity can be addressed by manual microdissection, prior to conducting experiments, computational treatment on heterogeneous measurements have become a reliable alternative to perform this microdissection in silico. Favoring computation over manual purification has its advantages, such as time consumption, measuring responses of multiple cell types simultaneously, keeping samples intact of external perturbations and unaltered yield of molecular content. RESULTS: We formalize a probabilistic model, DSection, and show with simulations as well as with real microarray data that DSection attains increased modeling accuracy in terms of (i) estimating cell-type proportions of heterogeneous tissue samples, (ii) estimating replication variance and (iii) identifying differential expression across cell types under various experimental conditions.

Many of these algorithms have been designed for specific tasks and validated with limited image data. But despite the potential of using extensive comparisons between algorithms to provide useful information to guide method selection and thus more accurate results, relatively few studies have been performed. RESULTS: To better understand algorithm performance under different conditions, we have carried out a comparative study including eleven spot detection or segmentation algorithms from various application fields. We used microscope images from well plate experiments with a human osteosarcoma cell line and frames from image stacks of yeast cells in different focal planes. These experimentally derived images permit a comparison of method performance in realistic situations where the number of objects varies within image set. We also used simulated microscope images in order to compare the methods and validate them against a ground truth reference result. Our study finds major differences in the performance of different algorithms, in terms of both object counts and segmentation accuracies. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the selection of detection algorithms for image based screens should be done carefully and take into account different conditions, such as the possibility of acquiring empty images or images with very few spots. Our inclusion of methods that have not been used before in this context broadens the set of available detection methods and compares them against the current state-of-the-art methods for subcellular particle detection.",2010,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,248,,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This technique has drawn great interest in the stem cell community, as it may provide a simple approach to the enrichment of progenitor cells from a variety of normal and malignant tissues. The frequency of these cells and their performance in functional assays has varied considerably within the literature. To investigate mechanisms that may contribute to the SP phenotype, we measured the fluorescence emission of Hoechst-stained bone marrow cells as a function of both time and dye concentration using a custom flow cytometer and data acquisition software. These measurements demonstrate that all nucleated cells within the bone marrow undergo an identical staining pattern at varying rates, even under conditions previously reported to abrogate the SP. Therefore, the SP phenotype is not unique to stem cells, but rather represents a transient feature of marrow cells exposed to Hoechst 33342 for varying amounts of time. We propose that heterogeneity of SP-defined populations may be a consequence of the rate at which differing cell populations accumulate Hoechst 33342.

Ex vivo studies also show that IL-10 and ApoE can individually impair glial Abeta phagocytosis. Our observations that IL-10 has an unexpected negative effect on Abeta proteostasis and cognition in APP mouse models demonstrate the complex interplay between innate immunity and proteostasis in neurodegenerative diseases, an interaction we call immunoproteostasis.",2/4/15,2/8/16 23:45,2/9/16 0:19,,519-533,,3,85,,Neuron,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Within a given cluster, gene segment usage during recombination is thought to be largely random, with biased representation in mature T lymphocytes resulting from protein-mediated selection of a subset of the total repertoire. Here we show that T cell receptor D beta and J beta gene segment usage is not random, but is patterned at the time of recombination. The hierarchy of gene segment usage is independent of gene segment proximity, but rather is influenced by the ability of the flanking recombination signal sequences (RSS) to bind the recombinase and/or to form a paired synaptic complex. Importantly, the relative frequency of gene segment usage established during recombination is very similar to that found after protein-mediated selection, suggesting that in addition to targeting recombinase activity, the RSS may have evolved to bias the naive repertoire in favor of useful gene products.",10/16/00,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,1191-6,,8,192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Genes; *Recombination; Animals; Base Sequence; Consensus Sequence; DNA; DNA Primers; Genetic; Inbred C57BL; Kidney/immunology; Mice; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ribosomal/genetics; T-Cell Receptor; T-Cell Receptor beta; T-Lymphocytes/*immunology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The raw data for these analyses are measured in tens to hundreds of gigabytes per genome; transmitting, storing, and analyzing such large files is cumbersome, particularly for methods that analyze several samples simultaneously. We developed a very efficient representation of depth of coverage (150-1000x compression) that enables such analyses. Current methods for analyzing variants in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data frequently miss copy number variants (CNVs), particularly hemizygous deletions in the 1-100 kb range. To fill this gap, we developed a method to identify CNVs in individual genomes, based on comparison to joint profiles pre-computed from a large set of genomes. We analyzed depth of coverage in over 6000 high quality (>40x) genomes. The depth of coverage has strong sequence-specific fluctuations only partially explained by global parameters like %GC. To account for these fluctuations, we constructed multi-genome profiles representing the observed or inferred diploid depth of coverage at each position along the genome. These Reference Coverage Profiles (RCPs) take into account the diverse technologies and pipeline versions used. Normalization of the scaled coverage to the RCP followed by hidden Markov model (HMM) segmentation enables efficient detection of CNVs and large deletions in individual genomes. Use of pre-computed multi-genome coverage profiles improves our ability to analyze each individual genome. We make available RCPs and tools for performing these analyses on personal genomes. We expect the increased sensitivity and specificity for individual genome analysis to be critical for achieving clinical-grade genome interpretation.",2015,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,45,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 50% of Pol II is found associated with the general transcription factor TFIIF (Pol II-TFIIF), and about 20% of Pol II is associated with Mediator (Pol-Med). No Pol II-Med-TFIIF complex was observed. The activity of Pol II and the purified Pol II complexes in transcription initiation and reinitiation was investigated by supplementing extracts depleted of either total Pol II or total TFIIF with purified Pol II or the Pol II complexes. We found that all three forms of Pol II can complement Pol II-depleted extracts for transcription initiation, but Pol II-TFIIF has the highest specific activity. Similarly, Pol II-TFIIF has a much higher specific activity than TFIIF for complementation of TFIIF transcription activity. Although the Pol II-TFIIF and Pol II-Med complexes were stable when purified, we found these complexes were dynamic in extracts under transcription conditions, with a single polymerase capable of exchanging bound Mediator and TFIIF. Using a purified system to examine transcription reinitiation, we found that Pol II-TFIIF was active in promoting multiple rounds of transcription while Pol II-Med was nearly inactive. These results suggest that both the Pol II-Med and Pol II-TFIIF complexes can be recruited for transcription initiation but that only the Pol II-TFIIF complex is competent for transcription reinitiation.",2004-02,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,1709-20,,4,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Transcription; Cell Extracts; Cell-Free System; Fungal; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic; Genetic Complementation Test; Nuclear Proteins/metabolism; RNA Polymerase II/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/cytology/*genetics; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/metabolism; TFII/*metabolism; Transcription Factors; Transcription Factors/*metabolism; Transcription Factor TFIIB/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have addressed this limitation by adopting quantitative mass spectrometric approaches to identify proteins that enrich in a purified fraction of organelles relative to a crude or contaminating fraction.

Myd88-/- mice were nonetheless normoglycemic both at rest and after an intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT). In contrast, after low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) challenge, Myd88-/-mice had an abnormal IPGTT relative to WT controls. Furthermore, Myd88-/- mice suffer enhanced beta-cell apoptosis and have enhanced hepatic damage with delayed recovery upon low-dose STZ treatment.

The introduction of the Bax mutation onto mixed background Dnd1(Ter/Ter) mutants, where teratomas do not typically develop, resulted in a high incidence of teratomas. However, when Dnd1(Ter/Ter); Bax(-/-) double mutants were backcrossed to C57BL/6J, no tumors arose. Dnd1(Ter/Ter) germ cells show a strong downregulation of male differentiation genes including Nanos2. In susceptible strains, where teratomas initiate around E15.5-E17.5, many mutant germ cells fail to enter mitotic arrest in G0 and do not downregulate the pluripotency markers NANOG, SOX2 and OCT4. We show that DND1 directly binds a group of transcripts that encode negative regulators of the cell cycle, including p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip)(1). P27(Kip1) and P21(Cip1) protein are both significantly decreased in Dnd1(Ter/Ter) germ cells on all strain backgrounds tested, strongly suggesting that DND1 regulates mitotic arrest in male germ cells through translational regulation of cell cycle genes. Nonetheless, in C57BL/6J mutants, germ cells arrest prior to M-phase of the cell cycle and downregulate NANOG, SOX2 and OCT4. Consistent with their ability to rescue cell cycle arrest, C57BL/6J germ cells overexpress negative regulators of the cell cycle relative to 129/SvJ. This work suggests that reprogramming of pluripotency in germ cells and prevention of tumor formation requires cell cycle arrest, and that differences in the balance of cell cycle regulators between 129/SvJ and C57BL/6 might underlie differences in tumor susceptibility.",2011-01,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,23-32,,1,138,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3T3 Cells; Animals; Blotting; Cadherins/genetics/metabolism; Cell Cycle/genetics/*physiology; Cell Differentiation/genetics/*physiology; Germ Cells/*cytology/*metabolism; Homeodomain Proteins; Immunohistochemistry; Immunoprecipitation; Male; Mice; Mutant Strains; Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Proteins/genetics/metabolism; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; SOXB1 Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism; Teratoma/genetics/metabolism; Western,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown previously that CXCL1 overexpression in melanoma cells is due to increased transcription as well as stability of the CXCL1 message. The transcription of CXCL1 is regulated through several cis-acting elements including Sp1, NF-kappaB, HMGI(Y), and the immediate upstream region (IUR) element (nucleotides -94 to -78), which lies immediately upstream to the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) element. Previously, it has been shown that the IUR is necessary for basal and cytokine-induced transcription of the CXCL1 gene. UV cross-linking and Southwestern blot analyses indicate that the IUR oligonucleotide probe selectively binds a 115-kDa protein. In this study, the IUR element has been further characterized. We show here that proximity of the IUR element to the adjacent NF-kappaB element is critical to its function as a positive regulatory element. Using binding site oligonucleotide affinity chromatography, we have selectively purified the 115-kDa IUR-F. Mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight spectroscopy and amino acid analysis as well as microcapillary reverse phase chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry identified this protein as the 114-kDa poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1).

NLRP3 is a key component of one of several distinct cytoplasmic multiprotein complexes (inflammasomes) that mediate the maturation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1Ã«_ (IL-1Ã«_) by activating caspase-1. Although several models for inflammasome activation, such as K(+) efflux, generation of reactive oxygen species and lysosomal destabilization, have been proposed, the precise molecular mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as well as the mechanism by which CAPS-associated mutations activate NLRP3, remain to be elucidated. Here we show that the murine calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, mediated by increased intracellular Ca(2+) and decreased cellular cyclic AMP (cAMP). Ca(2+) or other CASR agonists activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in the absence of exogenous ATP, whereas knockdown of CASR reduces inflammasome activation in response to known NLRP3 activators. CASR activates the NLRP3 inflammasome through phospholipase C, which catalyses inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate production and thereby induces release of Ca(2+) from endoplasmic reticulum stores. The increased cytoplasmic Ca(2+) promotes the assembly of inflammasome components, and intracellular Ca(2+) is required for spontaneous inflammasome activity in cells from patients with CAPS. CASR stimulation also results in reduced intracellular cAMP, which independently activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. cAMP binds to NLRP3 directly to inhibit inflammasome assembly, and downregulation of cAMP relieves this inhibition. The binding affinity of cAMP for CAPS-associated mutant NLRP3 is substantially lower than for wild-type NLRP3, and the uncontrolled mature IL-1Ã«_ production from CAPS patientsâ€°Ã›Âª peripheral blood mononuclear cells is attenuated by increasing cAMP.

SOX2 appears to re-activate in several human cancerss including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), however, the detailed response program of SOX2 in GBM has not yet been defined. RESULTS: We show that knockdown of the SOX2 gene in LN229 GBM cells reduces cell proliferation and colony formation. We then comprehensively characterize the SOX2 response program by an integrated analysis using several advanced genomic technologies including ChIP-seq, microarray profiling, and microRNA sequencing. Using ChIP-seq technology, we identified 4883 SOX2 binding regions in the GBM cancers genome. SOX2 binding regions contain the consensus sequence wwTGnwTw that occurred 3931 instances in 2312 SOX2 binding regions. Microarray analysis identified 489 genes whose expression altered in response to SOX2 knockdown. Interesting findings include that SOX2 regulates the expression of SOX family proteins SOX1 and SOX18, and that SOX2 down regulates BEX1 (brain expressed X-linked 1) and BEX2 (brain expressed X-linked 2), two genes with tumor suppressor activity in GBM. Using next generation sequencing, we identified 105 precursor microRNAs (corresponding to 95 mature miRNAs) regulated by SOX2, including down regulation of miR-143, -145, -253-5p and miR-452. We also show that miR-145 and SOX2 form a double negative feedback loop in GBM cells, potentially creating a bistable system in GBM cells. CONCLUSIONS: We present an integrated dataset of ChIP-seq, expression microarrays and microRNA sequencing representing the SOX2 response program in LN229 GBM cells. The insights gained from our integrated analysis further our understanding of the potential actions of SOX2 in carcinogenesis and serves as a useful resource for the research community.",2011,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,11,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have established a role for karyopherins in this process. We show that the yeast karyopherin Kap121p functions in the targeting and assembly of the nucleoporin Nup53p into NPCs by recognizing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in Nup53p. This karyopherin-mediated function can also be performed by the Kap95p-Kap60p complex if the Kap121p-binding domain of Nup53p is replaced by a classical NLS, suggesting a more general role for karyopherins in NPC assembly. At the NPC, neighboring nucleoporins bind to two regions in Nup53p. One nucleoporin, Nup170p, associates with a region of Nup53p that overlaps with the Kap121p binding site and we show that they compete for binding to Nup53p. We propose that once targeted to the NPC, dissociation of the Kap121p-Nup53p complex is driven by the interaction of Nup53p with Nup170p. At the NPC, Nup53p exists in two separate complexes, one of which is capable of interacting with Kap121p and another that is bound to Nup170p. We propose that fluctuations between these two states drive the binding and release of Kap121p from Nup53p, thus facilitating Kap121pâ€°Ã›Âªs movement through the NPC.",10/28/02,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,267-78,,2,159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Membrane Transport Proteins; Binding Sites/physiology; Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/chemistry/*metabolism; Karyopherins/*metabolism; Mutagenesis/physiology; Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism; Nuclear Pore/*metabolism; Protein Structure; Receptors; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism; Tertiary; Yeasts/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rather, multiple entangled paths of information flow influence overlapping sets of genes. Using the Ras-cAMP pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system, we perturbed key pathway elements and collected genomic-expression data. Singular value decomposition was applied to separate the genome-wide transcriptional response into weighted expression components exhibited by overlapping groups of genes. Molecular interaction data were integrated to connect gene groups to perturbed signaling elements.

This is particularly problematic for system-level studies using non-adherent model organisms such as yeast, where the motion of cells complicates tracking and where large-scale analysis under a variety of genetic and chemical perturbations is desired. We present here a high-throughput microfluidic imaging system capable of tracking single cells over multiple generations in 128 simultaneous experiments with programmable and precise chemical control. High-resolution imaging and robust cell tracking are achieved through immobilization of yeast cells using a combination of mechanical clamping and polymerization in an agarose gel.

Five OR genes are identified in the human cluster. The murine cluster has at least six OR genes; the first five are orthologous to the human genes. The sixth mouse gene has arisen since mouse-human divergence by a duplication of a approximately 10-kb block. One pair of OR paralogs found at the mouse and human loci are more similar to each other than to their corresponding orthologs. This paralogous ""twinning"" appears to be under selection, perhaps to increase sensitivity to particular odorants or to resolve structurally-similar odorants. The promoter regions of the mouse OR genes were identified by RACE-PCR. Orthologs share extensive 5â€°Ã›Âª UTR homology, but we find no significant similarity among paralogs. These findings extend previous observations that suggest that OR genes do not share local significant regulatory homology despite having a common regulatory agenda. We also identified a diverged TCR-alpha gene segment that uses a divergent recombination signal sequence (RSS) to initiate recombination in T-cells from within the OR region. We explored the hypothesis that OR genes may use DNA recombination in expressing neurons, e.g., to recombine ORs into a transcriptionally active locus.

Several RNAi screens have identified previously uncharacterised genes that are implicated in mammalian cell division. The molecular function for these genes needs to be investigated to place them into pathways. Phenotypic profiling is a useful method to assign putative functions to uncharacterised genes. Here, we show that the analysis of protein localisation is useful to refine a phenotypic profile. We show the utility of this approach by defining a function of the previously uncharacterised gene C13orf3 during cell division. C13orf3 localises to centrosomes, the mitotic spindle, kinetochores, spindle midzone, and the cleavage furrow during cell division and is specifically phosphorylated during mitosis. Furthermore, C13orf3 is required for centrosome integrity and anaphase onset. Depletion by RNAi leads to mitotic arrest in metaphase with an activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and loss of sister chromatid cohesion. Proteomic analyses identify C13orf3 (Ska3) as a new component of the Ska complex and show a direct interaction with a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase PP2A.

We have systematically compared RNASEQR with four of the most widely used tools using a simulated data set created from the Consensus CDS project and two experimental RNA-seq data sets generated from a human glioblastoma patient. Our results showed that RNASEQR yields more accurate estimates for gene expression, complete gene structures and new transcript isoforms, as well as more accurate detection of single nucleotide variants (SNVs). RNASEQR analyzes raw data from RNA-seq experiments effectively and outputs results in a manner that is compatible with a wide variety of specialized downstream analyses on desktop computers.",3/1/12,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e42,,6,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further investigate the role of this family of proteins in microtubule function, we screened for mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that confer sensitivity to microtubule-destabilizing drugs. One mutant exhibiting this phenotype lacked the gene encoding the karyopherin Kap123p. Analysis of kap123Delta cells revealed that the drug sensitivity was caused by a defect in microtubule stability and/or assembly. In support of this idea, we demonstrated genetic interactions between the kap123Delta mutation and mutated alleles of genes encoding alpha-tubulins and factors controlling microtubule dynamics. Moreover, kap123Delta cells exhibit defects in spindle structure and dynamics as well as nuclear positioning defects during mitosis. Cultures of kap123Delta strains are enriched for mononucleated large-budded cells often containing short spindles and nuclei positioned away from the budneck, phenotypes indicative of defects in both cytoplasmic and nuclear microtubules. Finally, we identified a gene, CAJ1, which when deleted in combination with KAP123 exacerbated the microtubule-related defects of the kap123Delta mutants. We propose that Kap123p and Caj1p, a member of the Hsp40 family of proteins, together play an essential role in normal microtubule function.",2009-11,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,1619-34,,11,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such critical dynamics of the network permits the coexistence of robustness and flexibility which are necessary to ensure homeostatic stability (of a given phenotype) while allowing for switching between multiple phenotypes (network states) as occurs in development and in response to environmental change. However, the mechanisms through which genetic networks evolve such critical behavior have remained elusive. Here we present an evolutionary model in which criticality naturally emerges from the need to balance between the two essential components of evolvability: phenotype conservation and phenotype innovation under mutations. We simulated the Darwinian evolution of random Boolean networks that mutate gene regulatory interactions and grow by gene duplication. The mutating networks were subjected to selection for networks that both (i) preserve all the already acquired phenotypes (dynamical attractor states) and (ii) generate new ones. Our results show that this interplay between extending the phenotypic landscape (innovation) while conserving the existing phenotypes (conservation) suffices to cause the evolution of all the networks in a population towards criticality. Furthermore, the networks produced by this evolutionary process exhibit structures with hubs (global regulators) similar to the observed topology of real gene regulatory networks. Thus, dynamical criticality and certain elementary topological properties of gene regulatory networks can emerge as a byproduct of the evolvability of the phenotypic landscape.",2012,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e1002669,,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Biological Evolution; Computer Simulation; Evolution; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic; genetics; Humans; Models; Molecular; Mutation; Population; Selection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a large-scale meta-analysis of gene expression in human pancreatic islet cells, which were processed using three different previously described protocols for expansion and for which redifferentiation was attempted. All three expansion protocols induced dramatic changes in the expression profiles of pancreatic islets; many of these changes are shared among the three protocols. Attempts at redifferentiation of expanded cells induce a limited number of gene expression changes. Nevertheless, these fail to restore a pancreatic islet-like gene expression pattern. Comparison with a collection of public microarray datasets confirmed that expanded cells are highly comparable to mesenchymal stem cells.

PRSS1 and PRSS2 are located on chromosome 7q35, while PRSS3 is found on chromosome 9p13. Here, we report a variation of the theme of new gene creation by duplication: the PRSS3 gene was formed by segmental duplications originating from chromosomes 7q35 and 11q24. As a result, PRSS3 transcripts display two variants of exon 1. The PRSS3 transcript whose gene organization most resembles PRSS1 and PRSS2 encodes a functional protein originally named mesotrypsinogen. The other variant is a fusion transcript, called trypsinogen IV. We show that the first exon of trypsinogen IV is derived from the noncoding first exon of LOC120224, a chromosome 11 gene. LOC120224 codes for a widely conserved transmembrane protein of unknown function. Comparative analyses suggest that these interchromosomal duplications occurred after the divergence of Old World monkeys and hominids. PRSS3 transcripts consist of a mixed population of mRNAs, some expressed in the pancreas and encoding an apparently functional trypsinogen and others of unknown function expressed in brain and a variety of other tissues. Analysis of the selection pressures acting on the trypsinogen gene family shows that, while the apparently functional genes are under mild to strong purifying selection overall, a few residues appear under positive selection.

Often such temporal profiles contain features due to transient states that present unique modeling challenges. These could range from asymmetric non-Gaussian distributions to outliers and tail subpopulations, which need to be modeled with precision and rigor. <b>RESULTS: </b>To ensure precision and rigor, we propose a parametric modeling framework StateProfiler based on finite mixtures of skew t-Normal distributions that are robust against non-Gaussian features caused by asymmetry and outliers in data. Further, we present in StateProfiler a new greedy EM algorithm for fast and optimal model selection. The parsimonious approach of our greedy algorithm allows us to detect the genuine dynamic variation in the key features as and when they appear in time course data. We also present a procedure to construct a well-fitted profile by merging any redundant model components in a way that minimizes change in entropy of the resulting model. This allows precise profiling of unusually shaped distributions and less well-separated features that may appear due to cellular heterogeneity even within clonal populations. <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>By modeling flow cytometric data measured over time course and marker space with StateProfiler, specific parametric characteristics of cellular states can be identified. The parameters are then tested statistically for learning global and local patterns of spatio-temporal change. We applied StateProfiler to identify the temporal features of yeast cell cycle progression based on knockout of S-phase triggering cyclins Clb5 and Clb6, and then compared the S-phase delay phenotypes due to differential regulation of the two cyclins. We also used StateProfiler to construct the temporal profile of clonal divergence underlying lineage selection in mammalian hematopoietic progenitor cells.",2012,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,S5,,,13 Suppl 5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Algorithms; Cell Cycle; Cyclin B; Flow Cytometry; Normal Distribution; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; S Phase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanistic link between BMP and PTEN pathways and the related etiology of juvenile polyposis is unresolved.

At a finer scale, small groups of strains from cacao, olives, and sake are defined by unique variants not present in other strains. One population, containing strains from a variety of fermentations, exhibits high levels of heterozygosity and a mixture of alleles from European and Asian populations, indicating an admixed origin for this group.

However, the common way of computing the P-value, which expresses the statistical significance, requires a very large number of permutations when small (and thus interesting) P-values are to be accurately estimated. This is computationally expensive and often infeasible. Recently, we proposed an alternative estimator, which requires far fewer permutations compared to the standard empirical approach while still reliably estimating small P-values. RESULTS: The proposed P-value estimator has been enriched with additional functionalities and is made available to the general community through a public website and web service, called EPEPT. This means that the EPEPT routines can be accessed not only via a website, but also programmatically using any programming language that can interact with the web. Examples of web service clients in multiple programming languages can be downloaded. Additionally, EPEPT accepts data of various common experiment types used in computational biology. For these experiment types EPEPT first computes the permutation values and then performs the P-value estimation. Finally, the source code of EPEPT can be downloaded. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of users, such as biologists, bioinformaticians and software engineers, can use the method in an appropriate and simple way.

We demonstrate that macrophage lipid body formation can be induced by modified lipoproteins or by inflammatory Toll-like receptor agonists. We used an unbiased approach to study the overlap in these pathways to identify regulators that control foam cell formation and atherogenesis. An analysis method integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets with a transcription factor (TF) binding site prediction algorithm suggested that the TF ATF3 may regulate macrophage foam cell formation. Indeed, we found that deletion of this TF results in increased lipid body accumulation, and that ATF3 directly regulates transcription of the gene encoding cholesterol 25-hydroxylase. We further showed that production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) promotes macrophage foam cell formation. Finally, deletion of ATF3 in Apoe(-/-) mice led to in vivo increases in foam cell formation, aortic 25-HC levels, and disease progression. These results define a previously unknown role for ATF3 in controlling macrophage lipid metabolism and demonstrate that ATF3 is a key intersection point for lipid metabolic and inflammatory pathways in these cells.",4/9/12,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,807-17,,4,209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the limitations of previous network analyses is that they do not take into account the combinatorial nature of gene interactions within the network. We report here a new technique, Differential Rank Conservation (DIRAC), which permits one to assess these combinatorial interactions to quantify various biological pathways or networks in a comparative sense, and to determine how they change in different individuals experiencing the same disease process. This approach is based on the relative expression values of participating genes-i.e., the ordering of expression within network profiles. DIRAC provides quantitative measures of how network rankings differ either among networks for a selected phenotype or among phenotypes for a selected network. We examined disease phenotypes including cancers subtypes and neurological disorders and identified networks that are tightly regulated, as defined by high conservation of transcript ordering. Interestingly, we observed a strong trend to looser network regulation in more malignant phenotypes and later stages of disease. At a sample level, DIRAC can detect a change in ranking between phenotypes for any selected network. Variably expressed networks represent statistically robust differences between disease states and serve as signatures for accurate molecular classification, validating the information about expression patterns captured by DIRAC.

These prior experiments, focused on production of nascent DNA, have been interpreted to imply that the dynamics of replication fork progression are strongly affected by local chromatin structure/architecture, and by interaction with machineries controlling transcription, repair and epigenetic maintenance. Here, we adopted a complementary approach for assaying replication dynamics using whole genome time-resolved chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with microarray analysis of the GINS complex, an integral member of the replication fork. Surprisingly, our data show that this complex progresses at highly uniform rates regardless of genomic location, revealing that replication fork dynamics in yeast is simpler and more uniform than previously envisaged. In addition, we show how the synergistic use of experiment and modeling leads to novel biological insights. In particular, a parsimonious model allowed us to accurately simulate fork movement throughout the genome and also revealed a subtle phenomenon, which we interpret as arising from low-frequency fork arrest.",2010,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,353,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a continual introduction of new techniques whose usage ranges from in-house protocols through to high-throughput instrumentation.

RESULTS: The adaptable data management system discussed is designed to support the seamless mining and analysis of biological experiment data that is commonly used in systems biology (e.g. ChIP-chip, gene expression, proteomics, imaging, flow cytometry). We use different content graphs to represent different views upon the data. These views are designed for different roles: equipment specific views are used to gather instrumentation information; data processing oriented views are provided to enable the rapid development of analysis applications; and research project specific views are used to organize information for individual research experiments. This management system allows for both the rapid introduction of new types of information and the evolution of the knowledge it represents. CONCLUSION: Data management is an important aspect of any research enterprise. It is the foundation on which most applications are built, and must be easily extended to serve new functionality for new scientific areas.

For this purpose we defined two novel and mutually independent metrics: (1) the number of â€°Ã›Ãuniformâ€°Ã›Â genes (genes whose normalized expression levels have a sufficiently low coefficient of variation), and (2) low Spearman correlation between normalized expression profiles of gene pairs. We also define four novel algorithms, one of which explicitly maximizes the number of uniform genes, and compared the performance of all fifteen algorithms. The two most commonly used methods (scaling to a fixed total value, or equalizing the expression of certain â€°Ã›Ã·housekeepingâ€°Ã›Âª genes) yielded particularly poor results, surpassed even by normalization based on randomly selected gene sets. Conversely, seven of the algorithms approached what appears to be optimal normalization.

M.; Yin, L.; Hood, L.; Ao, P.","Robustness, stability and efficiency of phage lambda genetic switch: dynamical structure analysis",Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219720004000946,,"Based on the dynamical structure theory for complex networks recently developed by one of us and on the physical-chemical models for gene regulation, developed by Shea and Ackers in the 1980â€°Ã›Âªs, we formulate a direct and concise mathematical framework for the genetic switch controlling phage lambda life cycles, which naturally includes the stochastic effect. The dynamical structure theory states that the dynamics of a complex network is determined by its four elementary components: The dissipation (analogous to degradation), the stochastic force, the driving force determined by a potential, and the transverse force. The potential may be interpreted as a landscape for the phage development in terms of attractive basins, saddle points, peaks and valleys. The dissipation gives rise to the adaptivity of the phage in the landscape defined by the potential: The phage always has the tendency to approach the bottom of the nearby attractive basin. The transverse force tends to keep the network on the equal-potential contour of the landscape. The stochastic fluctuation gives the phage the ability to search around the potential landscape by passing through saddle points. With molecular parameters in our model fixed primarily by the experimental data on wild-type phage and supplemented by data on one mutant, our calculated results on mutants agree quantitatively with the available experimental observations on other mutants for protein number, lysogenization frequency, and a lysis frequency in lysogen culture. The calculation reproduces the observed robustness of the phage lambda genetic switch. This is the first mathematical description that successfully represents such a wide variety of major experimental phenomena. Specifically, we find: (1) The explanation for both the stability and the efficiency of phage lambda genetic switch is the exponential dependence of saddle point crossing rate on potential barrier height, a result of the stochastic motion in a landscape; and (2) The positive feedback of cI repressor gene transcription, enhanced by the CI dimer cooperative binding, is the key to the robustness of the phage lambda genetic switch against mutations and fluctuations in kinetic parameter values.",2004-12,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,785-817,,4,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bacteriophage lambda/ genetics; Computer Simulation; DNA-Binding Proteins/ genetics; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes; Genetic; Genomic Instability/genetics; Lysogeny/ genetics; Models; Repressor Proteins/genetics; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Statistical; Switch/ genetics; Viral/ genetics; Viral Proteins/ genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yeast two-hybrid experiments reveal that the TIR domains of human TLR differ in their ability to associate with MyD88: The TIR of TLR2 binds to MyD88 but the TIR of the closely related TLR1, 6, or 10 do not. Using chimeric TIR domains, we define the critical region responsible for differential MyD88 binding, and use a computational analysis of the critical region to reveal the amino acids that differ between MyD88 binders and non-binders. Remarkably, a single missense mutation created in TLR1 (N672D) confers on it the ability to bind MyD88, without affecting its association with other proteins. Mutations identified as critical for MyD88 binding also affect signaling of TLR pairs in mammalian cells. To investigate the difference between MyD88 binders and non-binders, we identify novel interacting proteins for each cytoplasmic domain of TLR1, 2, 6, and 10. For example, heat shock protein (HSP)60 binds to TLR1 but not to TLR2, and HSP60 and MyD88 appear to bind the same region of the TIR domain.

Understanding this process demands knowledge of components of both the soluble and stationary phases and the interface between them. Here, we provide evidence that Nup2p, previously considered to be a typical yeast nucleoporin that binds import- and export-bound karyopherins, dynamically associates with the NPC in a Ran-facilitated manner. When bound to the NPC, Nup2p associates with regions corresponding to the nuclear basket and cytoplasmic fibrils. On the nucleoplasmic face, where the Ranâ€°Ã›Ã’GTP levels are predicted to be high, Nup2p binds to Nup60p. Deletion of NUP60 renders Nup2p nucleoplasmic and compromises Nup2p-mediated recycling of Kap60p/Srp1p. Depletion of Ranâ€°Ã›Ã’GTP by metabolic poisoning, disruption of the Ran cycle, or in vitro by cell lysis, results in a shift of Nup2p from the nucleoplasm to the cytoplasmic face of the NPC.

Here, we show that AP-1 is also localized to phagocytic cups in murine macrophages as well as in Dictyostelium amoebae. AP-1 is recruited to phagosomal membranes at this early stage of phagosome formation and rapidly dissociates from maturing phagosomes. To establish the role of AP-1 in phagocytosis, we made used of Dictyostelium mutant cells (apm1(-) cells) disrupted for AP-1 medium chain. In this mutant, phagocytosis drops by 60%, indicating that AP-1 is necessary for efficient phagocytosis. Furthermore, phagocytosis in apm1(-) cells is more affected for large rather than small particles, and cells exhibiting incomplete engulfment are then often observed. This suggests that AP-1 could participate in the extension of the phagocytic cup. Interestingly, macropinocytosis, a process dedicated to fluid-phase endocytosis and related to phagocytosis, is also impaired in apm1(-) cells.

Applying the method to analyze a yeast RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex, we identified a new 8-kDa protein, encoded by the uncharacterized open reading frame YDR079c-a, as a potential new component of the preinitiation complex. Here we show that YDR079c-a is a bona fide component of polymerase II preinitiation complexes and investigate its role in transcription. YDR079c-a is recruited to promoters both in vivo and in vitro and is required for efficient transcription in vitro and for normal induction of GAL genes.

Yeast lacking YDR079c-a grow slowly, and, like strains carrying mutations in core TFIIH subunits, are sensitive to ultraviolet radiation. YDR079c-a is conserved throughout evolution, and mutations in the human ortholog account for a DNA repair-deficient form of the tricothiodystrophy disorder called TTD-A(2).

For phosphorylation analysis, the important contribution of MS has been critical but not definitive. There are numerous methods that have been applied with success, yet none are generally applicable to all analyses. So, for the time being, researchers in the field must select from a panel of methods to find (de)phosphorylation events.

C. beijerinckii is an attractive microorganism for strain design to improve butanol production because it (i) naturally produces the highest recorded butanol concentrations as a byproduct of fermentation; and (ii) can co-ferment pentose and hexose sugars (the primary products from lignocellulosic hydrolysis). Interrogating C. beijerinckii metabolism from a systems viewpoint using constraint-based modeling allows for simulation of the global effect of genetic modifications. RESULTS: We present the first genome-scale metabolic model (iCM925) for C. beijerinckii, containing 925 genes, 938 reactions, and 881 metabolites. To build the model we employed a semi-automated procedure that integrated genome annotation information from KEGG, BioCyc, and The SEED, and utilized computational algorithms with manual curation to improve model completeness. Interestingly, we found only a 34% overlap in reactions collected from the three databases--highlighting the importance of evaluating the predictive accuracy of the resulting genome-scale model. To validate iCM925, we conducted fermentation experiments using the NCIMB 8052 strain, and evaluated the ability of the model to simulate measured substrate uptake and product production rates. Experimentally observed fermentation profiles were found to lie within the solution space of the model; however, under an optimal growth objective, additional constraints were needed to reproduce the observed profiles--suggesting the existence of selective pressures other than optimal growth. Notably, a significantly enriched fraction of actively utilized reactions in simulations--constrained to reflect experimental rates--originated from the set of reactions that overlapped between all three databases (P = 3.52 x",2011,2/8/16 23:58,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,5,,BMC Syst Biol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,"*Bioreactors; *Models, Biological; Butanols/metabolism; Clostridium beijerinckii/genetics/*metabolism; Computer Simulation; Fermentation; Genome, Bacterial/*genetics; Hexoses/metabolism; Industrial Microbiology/*methods; Metabolic Networks and Pathways/*physiology; Pentoses/metabolism; Systems Biology/*methods",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately one thousand single pass genomic sequences per genome were obtained. The data were analyzed by comparative genomic analyses using the completed Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 genome as a reference. Low-pass shotgun sequencing is a simple, inexpensive, and rapid approach that can readily be performed on any cultured microbe. RESULTS: As expected, the four archaeal halophiles analyzed exhibit both bacterial and eukaryotic characteristics as well as uniquely archaeal traits. All five halophiles exhibit greater than sixty percent GC content and low isoelectric points (pI) for their predicted proteins. Multiple insertion sequence (IS) elements, often involved in genome rearrangements, were identified in H. lacusprofundi and H. marismortui. The core biological functions that govern cellular and genetic mechanisms of H. sp. NRC-1 appear to be conserved in these four other halophiles. Multiple TATA box binding protein (TBP) and transcription factor IIB (TFB) homologs were identified from most of the four shotgunned halophiles. The reconstructed molecular tree of all five halophiles shows a large divergence between these species, but with the closest relationship being between H. sp. NRC-1 and H. lacusprofundi. CONCLUSION: Despite the diverse habitats of these species, all five halophiles share (1) high GC content and (2) low protein isoelectric points, which are characteristics associated with environmental exposure to UV radiation and hypersalinity, respectively. Identification of multiple IS elements in the genome of H. lacusprofundi and H. marismortui suggest that genome structure and dynamic genome reorganization might be similar to that previously observed in the IS-element rich genome of H. sp. NRC-1. Identification of multiple TBP and TFB homologs in these four halophiles are consistent with the hypothesis that different types of complex transcriptional regulation may occur through multiple TBP-TFB combinations in response to rapidly changing environmental conditions.

Ideally, one would like to compare the transcriptomes of a cancers cell and its normal counterpart for differences. METHODS: Prostate luminal and basal epithelial cell types were isolated and cell-type-specific cDNA libraries were constructed. Sequence analysis of cDNA clones generated 505 luminal cell genes and 560 basal cell genes. These sequences were deposited in a public database for expression analysis. RESULTS: From these sequences, 119 unique luminal expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were extracted and assembled into a luminal-cell transcriptome set, while 154 basal ESTs were extracted and assembled into a basal-cell set. Interlibrary comparison was performed to determine representation of these sequences in cDNA libraries constructed from prostate tumors, PIN, cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that a significant number of epithelial cell genes were not represented in the various transcriptomes of prostate tissues, suggesting that they might be underrepresented in libraries generated from tissue containing multiple cell types. Although both luminal and basal cell types are epithelial, their transcriptomes are more divergent from each other than expected, underscoring their functional difference (secretory vs. nonsecretory). Tumor tissues show different expression of luminal and basal genes, with perhaps a trend towards expression of basal genes in advanced diseases.",2/1/02,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,92-103,,2,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Complementary/ genetics; Databases; DNA; Epithelial Cells/physiology; Expressed Sequence Tags; Factual; Flow Cytometry; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Library; Genetic; Humans; Male; Neoplasm; Neoplastic; Prostate/ physiology; Prostatic Neoplasms/ genetics/physiopathology; Transcription,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that host cells infected with L. amazonensis upregulate transcription of LYST/Beige, which was previously shown to regulate lysosome size. Mutations in LYST/Beige caused further PV expansion and enhanced L. amazonensis replication. In contrast, LYST/Beige overexpression led to small PVs that did not sustain parasite growth. Treatment of LYST/Beige over-expressing cells with vacuolin-1 reversed this phenotype, expanding PVs and promoting parasite growth. The opposite was seen with E-64d, which reduced PV size in LYST-Beige mutant cells and inhibited L. amazonensis replication. Enlarged PVs appear to protect parasites from oxidative damage, since inhibition of nitric oxide synthase had no effect on L. amazonensis viability within large PVs, but enhanced their growth within LYST/Beige-induced small PVs. Thus, the upregulation of LYST/Beige in infected cells functions as a host innate response to limit parasite growth, by reducing PV volume and inhibiting intracellular survival.",2008-10,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,e1000179,,10,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology; Cells; Cell Survival/genetics; Cultured; Host-Parasite Interactions/genetics/*physiology; Immunity; Inbred C57BL; Innate/genetics; Leishmania/drug effects/*growth & development/physiology; Leishmaniasis/genetics/parasitology/pathology/veterinary; Macrophages/metabolism/pathology; Messenger/metabolism; Mice; Nitric Oxide/metabolism/pharmacology; Organelle Size/genetics; Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology; RNA; Up-Regulation; Vacuoles/microbiology/*pathology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, most of the susceptibility genes that contribute to highly heritable conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) remain to be identified despite intensive study. We took advantage of mouse models of diet-induced metabolic disease in chromosome substitution strains (CSSs) both to characterize the genetic architecture of diet-induced obesity and glucose homeostasis, and to test feasibility of gene discovery. Beginning with a survey of CSSs, followed with genetic and phenotypic analysis of congenic, subcongenic and subsubcongenic strains, we identified a remarkable number of closely linked, phenotypically heterogeneous quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on mouse chromosome 6 that have unexpectedly large phenotypic effects. Although fine-mapping reduced the genomic intervals and gene content of these QTLs over 3,000-fold, the average phenotypic effect on body weight was reduced less than 3-fold, highlighting the â€°Ã›Âªfractalâ€°Ã›Âª nature of genetic architecture in mice.

The orang-utan species, Pongo abelii (Sumatran) and Pongo pygmaeus (Bornean), are the most phylogenetically distant great apes from humans, thereby providing an informative perspective on hominid evolution. Here we present a Sumatran orang-utan draft genome assembly and short read sequence data from five Sumatran and five Bornean orang-utan genomes. Our analyses reveal that, compared to other primates, the orang-utan genome has many unique features. Structural evolution of the orang-utan genome has proceeded much more slowly than other great apes, evidenced by fewer rearrangements, less segmental duplication, a lower rate of gene family turnover and surprisingly quiescent Alu repeats, which have played a major role in restructuring other primate genomes. We also describe a primate polymorphic neocentromere, found in both Pongo species, emphasizing the gradual evolution of orang-utan genome structure. Orang-utans have extremely low energy usage for a eutherian mammal, far lower than their hominid relatives. Adding their genome to the repertoire of sequenced primates illuminates new signals of positive selection in several pathways including glycolipid metabolism. From the population perspective, both Pongo species are deeply diverse; however, Sumatran individuals possess greater diversity than their Bornean counterparts, and more species-specific variation. Our estimate of Bornean/Sumatran speciation time, 400,000 years ago, is more recent than most previous studies and underscores the complexity of the orang-utan speciation process. Despite a smaller modern census population size, the Sumatran effective population size (N(e)) expanded exponentially relative to the ancestral N(e) after the split, while Bornean N(e) declined over the same period.

Epistasis analyses revealed a link between Yta7, Spt16, and other previously identified members of the histone regulatory pathway. In concurrence, Yta7 was found to regulate histone gene transcription in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. Association at the histone gene loci appeared to occur through binding of the bromodomain-like region of Yta7 with the N-terminal tail of histone H3. Our work suggests a mechanism in which Yta7 is localized to chromatin to establish regions of transcriptional silencing, and that one facet of this cellular mechanism is to modulate transcription of histone genes.",2008-05,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,291-304,,1,179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Epistasis; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Chromosomal Proteins; DNA Primers/genetics; Flow Cytometry; Fungal/*genetics; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic; Histones/*metabolism; Mass Spectrometry; Non-Histone/*metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics/metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/*metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Annotating these proteins of unknown function remains a critical bottleneck for systems biology and is crucial to understanding the biological relevance of genome-wide changes in mRNA and protein expression, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The work reported here demonstrates that de novo structure prediction is now a viable option for providing general function information for many proteins of unknown function. RESULTS: We have used Rosetta de novo structure prediction to predict three-dimensional structures for 1,185 proteins and protein domains (<150 residues in length) found in Halobacterium NRC-1, a widely studied halophilic archaeon. Predicted structures were searched against the Protein Data Bank to identify fold similarities and extrapolate putative functions. They were analyzed in the context of a predicted association network composed of several sources of functional associations such as: predicted protein interactions, predicted operons, phylogenetic profile similarity and domain fusion. To illustrate this approach, we highlight three cases where our combined procedure has provided novel insights into our understanding of chemotaxis, possible prophage remnants in Halobacterium NRC-1 and archaeal transcriptional regulators. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous analysis of the association network, coordinated mRNA level changes in microarray experiments and genome-wide structure prediction has allowed us to glean significant biological insights into the roles of several Halobacterium NRC-1 proteins of previously unknown function, and significantly reduce the number of proteins encoded in the genome of this haloarchaeon for which no annotation is available.",2004,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,R52,,8,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the complete Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 genome sequence showed that the regulatory site, upstream activator sequence (UAS), the putative binding site for Bat upstream of the bacterio-opsin gene (bop), is also present upstream to the other Bat-regulated genes. The transcription regulator Bat contains a photoresponsive cGMP-binding (GAF) domain, and a bacterial AraC type helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif. We also provide evidence for involvement of the PAS/PAC domain of Bat in redox-sensing activity by genetic analysis of a purple membrane overproducer. Five additional Bat-like putative regulatory genes were found, which together are likely to be responsible for orchestrating the complex response of this archaeon to light and oxygen. Similarities of the bop-like UAS and transcription factors in diverse organisms, including a plant and a gamma-proteobacterium, suggest an ancient origin for this regulon capable of coordinating light and oxygen responses in the three major branches of the evolutionary tree of life.

Familial transmission in MMD is common. Recently, mutations in human RNF213 and ACTA2 genes were identified to be responsible for MMD. The present study was to determine whether Taiwanese MMD patients carried mutations in these two genes. Of the 36 MMD patients, eleven was found to have RNF213 mutations. Direct genetic sequencing identified four different RNF213 mutations in the 11 patients from 8 families: five with a p.R4810K, one with p.A1622V, one with p.V3933M, and the other one with p.R4131C. The latter three represent novel missense mutations. No mutation in ACTA2 gene was identified. Clinically, cerebral infarction was common in patients with an RNF213 mutation (9/11). In addition, four mutant patients had developmental delay (4/11) and two had mental dysfunction (2/11). The magnetic resonance angiography of asymptomatic mutant carriers demonstrated high incidence of multiple stenosis of intracranial vessels (3/6, 50%). Since 30.6% (11/36) of Taiwanese moyamoya patients carry an RNF213 mutation and intracranial arterial stenosis was found in half of the asymptomatic mutant carriers, it is suggested that the RNF213 mutation should form part of the diagnostic workup for MMD in clinical practice.",6/15/15,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,161-5,,,353,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In one gene model, transcription begins at exon 1 and ends at exon 15b. Another gene model begins transcription at exon 20 and terminates at exon 23, 24, or 28. In a third gene model, transcription begins at exon 1 and ends at exon 23, thus conjoining two apparently discrete genes into a third combined gene. Exon 15 can function as a terminating exon or as an alternatively spliced internal exon, or it can be skipped altogether. Exons 11, 14, 15a, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20a, and 20f are found only in transcripts that do not terminate at exon 15b. Combined transcripts that convert two genes into a third provide evidence for an unusual form of gene organization and expression that we call the complex transcription unit (CTU).

Recent technological advances have enabled sequencing large numbers of related genomes in a single project, requiring computational tools for their integrated analysis. In particular, accurate annotations and identification of gene presence and absence are critical for understanding and modeling the cellular physiology of newly sequenced genomes. Although many tools are available to compare the gene contents of related genomes, new tools are necessary to enable close examination and curation of protein families from large numbers of closely related organisms, to integrate curation with the analysis of gain and loss, and to generate metabolic networks linking the annotations to observed phenotypes. RESULTS: We have developed ITEP, an Integrated Toolkit for Exploration of microbial Pan-genomes, to curate protein families, compute similarities to externally-defined domains, analyze gene gain and loss, and generate draft metabolic networks from one or more curated reference network reconstructions in groups of related microbial species among which the combination of core and variable genes constitute the their ""pan-genomes"". The ITEP toolkit consists of: (1) a series of modular command-line scripts for identification, comparison, curation, and analysis of protein families and their distribution across many genomes; (2) a set of Python libraries for programmatic access to the same data; and (3) pre-packaged scripts to perform common analysis workflows on a collection of genomes. ITEP's capabilities include de novo protein family prediction, ortholog detection, analysis of functional domains, identification of core and variable genes and gene regions, sequence alignments and tree generation, annotation curation, and the integration of cross-genome analysis and metabolic networks for study of metabolic network evolution. CONCLUSIONS: ITEP is a powerful, flexible toolkit for generation and curation of protein families. ITEP's modular design allows for straightforward extension as analysis methods and tools evolve. By integrating comparative genomics with the development of draft metabolic networks, ITEP harnesses the power of comparative genomics to build confidence in links between genotype and phenotype and helps disambiguate gene annotations when they are evaluated in both evolutionary and metabolic network contexts.",2014,2/8/16 23:58,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,15,,BMC Genomics,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,"*Software; Algorithms; Bacterial Proteins/genetics/metabolism; Clostridium/classification/genetics; Cluster Analysis; Databases, Genetic; Genome, Bacterial/*genetics; Genomics/*methods; Genotype; Internet; Metabolic Networks and Pathways/genetics; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Ribosomal Proteins/genetics/metabolism; User-Computer Interface",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We then propose a bottom-up approach in which large-scale GRNs are first organized in terms of functionally distinct GRN building blocks of one or a few genes. Biological processes may then be viewed as the outcome of functional interactions among these simple, well-characterized functional building blocks.

Mutations in EOGT and DOCK6 cause autosomal-recessive AOS, whereas mutations in ARHGAP31, RBPJ, and NOTCH1 lead to autosomal-dominant AOS. Because RBPJ, NOTCH1, and EOGT are involved in NOTCH signaling, we hypothesized that mutations in other genes involved in this pathway might also be implicated in AOS pathogenesis. Using a candidate-gene-based approach, we prioritized DLL4, a critical NOTCH ligand, due to its essential role in vascular development in the context of cardiovascular features in AOS-affected individuals. Targeted resequencing of the DLL4 gene with a custom enrichment panel in 89 independent families resulted in the identification of seven mutations. A defect in DLL4 was also detected in two families via whole-exome or genome sequencing. In total, nine heterozygous mutations in DLL4 were identified, including two nonsense and seven missense variants, the latter encompassing four mutations that replace or create cysteine residues, which are most likely critical for maintaining structural integrity of the protein. Affected individuals with DLL4 mutations present with variable clinical expression with no emerging genotype-phenotype correlations.

To understand this function of Nup2p, we investigated the interactions of Nup2p with other proteins and with DNA using immunopurifications coupled with mass spectrometry and microarray analyses.

Although Bcl6 has been shown to be essential in TFH-cell function, it may not regulate the initial migration of T cells or the induction of the TFH program, as exemplified by C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) upregulation.

Genome-wide analysis indicates that Ascl2 directly regulates TFH-related genes whereas it inhibits expression of T-helper cell 1 (TH1) and TH17 signature genes. Acute deletion of Ascl2, as well as blockade of its function with the Id3 protein in CD4(+) T cells, results in impaired TFH-cell development and germinal centre response.

This genetic complexity is mentioned frequently in the literature, but a consistent and quantitative definition is lacking. Here, we derive such a definition and investigate its consequences for model genetic systems. The definition equates genetic complexity with a surplus of genotypic diversity over phenotypic diversity. Applying this definition to ensembles of Boolean network models, we found that the in-degree distribution and the number of periodic attractors produced determine the relative complexity of different topology classes. We found evidence that networks that are difficult to control, or that exhibit a hierarchical structure, are genetically complex. We analyzed the complexity of the cell cycle network of Sacchoromyces cerevisiae and pinpointed genes and interactions that are most important for its high genetic complexity. The rigorous definition of genetic complexity is a tool for unraveling the structure and properties of genotype-to-phenotype maps by enabling the quantitative comparison of the relative complexities of different genetic systems. The definition also allows the identification of specific network elements and subnetworks that have the greatest effects on genetic complexity. Moreover, it suggests ways to engineer biological systems with desired genetic properties.",2012-07,9/14/15 19:04,2/9/16 0:19,,e1002583,,7,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While certain responses of these organisms to hydrogen availability have been characterized, responses to formate starvation have not been reported. Here we report that during continuous culture of Methanococcus maripaludis under defined nutrient conditions, growth yields relative to methane production decreased markedly with either H(2) excess or formate excess. Analysis of the growth yields of several mutants suggests that this phenomenon occurs independently of the storage of intracellular carbon or a transcriptional response to methanogenesis. Using microarray analysis, we show that the expression of genes encoding F(420)-dependent steps of methanogenesis, including one of two formate dehydrogenases, increased with H(2) starvation, but with formate occurred at high levels regardless of limitation or excess. One gene, encoding H(2)-dependent methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase, decreased in expression with either H(2) limitation or formate limitation. Expression of genes for the second formate dehydrogenase, molybdenum-dependent formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, and molybdenum transport increased specifically with formate limitation.

The identity of such structures as nuclear pores has been suggested, but not established. METHODS: We identified a cohort of patients (n = 14, including 1 patient with disease recurrence in an allograft) who presented with nephrotic syndrome and had renal biopsy specimens with light and immunofluorescence microscopic findings characteristic of membranous glomerulopathy. These patients were distinguished by ultrastructural studies that showed glomerular capillary wall accumulations of subepithelial immune deposits composed of uniform spherular structures, while lacking the typical granular electron-dense deposits seen in membranous glomerulopathy. The molecular identity of these spherular structures as nuclear pores was tested by using immunofluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry with mouse monoclonal antinuclear pore antibodies (Covance, Princeton, NJ) and anti-Nuclear Pore-O-Linked Glycoprotein (Affinity BioReagents Inc, Golden, CO) antibodies. RESULTS: Measurement of spherular structures by using high-magnification electron microscopy showed an average diameter of 84.5 nm, which correlated well with accepted diameters of nuclear pores (80 to 120 nm). Immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoperoxidase staining with both antibodies showed characteristic beaded staining of nuclear membranes of multiple cell types within normal control kidney, but no staining of immune-type deposits within glomerular basement membranes.

Instrumentation has steadily improved over time with the advent of faster and more sensitive instruments collecting ever larger data files. Consequently, the computational process of matching a peptide fragmentation pattern to its sequence, traditionally accomplished by sequence database searching and more recently also by spectral library searching, has become a bottleneck in many mass spectrometry experiments. In both of these methods, the main rate-limiting step is the comparison of an acquired spectrum with all potential matches from a spectral library or sequence database. This is a highly parallelizable process because the core computational element can be represented as a simple but arithmetically intense multiplication of two vectors. In this paper, we present a proof of concept project taking advantage of the massively parallel computing available on graphics processing units (GPUs) to distribute and accelerate the process of spectral assignment using spectral library searching.

Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the ExPa matrix P has previously been used to characterize the metabolic regulatory problem in the human red blood cell (hRBC) from a network perspective. The calculation of ExPas is NP-hard, and for genome-scale networks the computation of ExPas has proven to be infeasible. Therefore an alternative approach is needed to reveal regulatory properties of steady state solution spaces of genome-scale stoichiometric matrices. RESULTS: We show that the SVD of a matrix (W) formed of random samples from the steady-state solution space of the hRBC metabolic network gives similar insights into the regulatory properties of the network as was obtained with SVD of P. This new approach has two main advantages. First, it works with a direct representation of the shape of the metabolic solution space without the confounding factor of a non-uniform distribution of the extreme pathways and second, the SVD procedure can be applied to a very large number of samples, such as will be produced from genome-scale networks.

We followed up on the gene most enriched for rare protein-altering variants in our cohort of supercentenarians, TSHZ3, by sequencing it in a second cohort of 99 long-lived individuals but did not find a significant enrichment. The genome of one supercentenarian had a pathogenic mutation in DSC2, known to predispose to arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which is recommended to be reported to this individual as an incidental finding according to a recent position statement by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Even with this pathogenic mutation, the proband lived to over 110 years. The entire list of rare protein-altering variants and DNA sequence of all 17 supercentenarian genomes is available as a resource to assist the discovery of the genetic basis of extreme longevity in future studies.",2014,2/5/16 22:14,2/9/16 0:19,,e112430,,11,9,,PLoS ONE,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 25390934 PMCID: PMC4229186,,,,,"Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Desmocollins; Female; Genome, Human; Genome-Wide Association Study; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Longevity; Male; Mutation; Sequence Analysis, DNA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, phosphorylation is a key component in signal transduction in all three domains of life, and histones can be modified in such a variety of ways that a histone code for gene regulation has been proposed. Shotgun proteomics is commonly used to identify post-translational modifications as well as chemical modifications from sample processing. However, it favors the detection of abundant peptides over the repertoire presented, and the data analysis usually requires advance specification of modification masses and target amino acids, their number constrained by available computational resources. Recent advances in data independent acquisition mass spectrometry technologies such as SWATH MS enable the recording of the complete peptide contents of samples, including peptides with modifications. Here we present a novel approach that applies the power of SWATH MS analysis to the automated pursuit of modified peptides. With the new SWATHProphetPTM functionality added to the open source SWATHProphet software, precursor ions consistent with a modification are identified along with the mass and localization of the modification in the peptide sequence, in a sensitive and unbiased manner without the need to anticipate the modifications in advance. Using this method, we demonstrate the detection of a wide assortment of modified peptides, many unanticipated, in samples containing unpurified synthetic peptides and human urine, as well as in phospho-enriched human tissue culture cell samples.",12/24/15,2/8/16 18:55,2/8/16 19:00,,,,,,,Mol Cell Proteomics,,,,,,,,Eng,,,,,,,,"<p>Keller, Andrew<br/>Bader, Samuel L<br/>Kusebauch, Ulrike<br/>Shteynberg, David<br/>Hood, Leroy<br/>Moritz, Robert L<br/>Mol Cell Proteomics. 2015 Dec 24. pii: mcp.M115.054478.</p>; The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:<br/>auth-address: Institute for Systems Biology, United States.

We evaluated the differential propensities of the Akt isoforms toward progression in the well-characterized RCAS/Ntv-a mouse model of PDGFB-driven low grade glioma. A constitutively active myristoylated form of Akt1 did not induce high-grade glioma (HGG). In stark contrast, Akt2 and Akt3 showed strong progression potential with 78% and 97% of tumors diagnosed as HGG, respectively. We further revealed that significant variations in polarity and hydropathy values among the Akt isoforms in both the pleckstrin homology domain (P domain) and regulatory domain (R domain) were critical in mediating glioma progression. Gene expression profiles from representative Akt-derived tumors indicated dominant and distinct roles for Akt3, consisting primarily of DNA repair pathways. TCGA data from human GBM closely reflected the DNA repair function, as Akt3 was significantly correlated with a 76-gene signature DNA repair panel. Consistently, compared with Akt1 and Akt2 overexpression models, Akt3-expressing human GBM cells had enhanced activation of DNA repair proteins, leading to increased DNA repair and subsequent resistance to radiation and temozolomide.

However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying these alterations are poorly understood. We sought to shed light on the deregulation of miRNA biogenesis promoting the aberrant miRNA expression profiles identified in these tumors. Using sequencing technology to perform both whole-transcriptome and small RNA sequencing of glioma patient samples, we examined precursor and mature miRNAs to directly evaluate the miRNA maturation process, and interrogated expression profiles for genes involved in the major steps of miRNA biogenesis. We found that ratios of mature to precursor forms of a large number of miRNAs increased with the progression from normal brain to low-grade and then to high-grade gliomas. The expression levels of genes involved in each of the three major steps of miRNA biogenesis (nuclear processing, nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, and cytoplasmic processing) were systematically altered in glioma tissues. Survival analysis of an independent data set demonstrated that the alteration of genes involved in miRNA maturation correlates with survival in glioma patients. Direct quantification of miRNA maturation with deep sequencing demonstrated that deregulation of the miRNA biogenesis pathway is a hallmark for glioma genesis and progression.

This work introduces a new analysis and visualization technique that is capable of representing all possible transitions between cell states compactly, quantitatively, and intuitively. This method considers the regulatory network of transcription factors that control cell type determination and then performs an analysis of network dynamics to identify stable expression profiles and the potential cell types that they represent. A visualization tool called CellDiff3D creates an intuitive three-dimensional graph that shows the overall direction and probability of transitions between all pairs of cell types within a lineage.

In a large case-control study of Swedish incident T1D patients and controls, 0-34 years of age, we tested whether the odds ratio (OR) measure of association was dependent on HLA or autoantibodies against the islet autoantigens glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 kDa autoantibodies (GADA), insulin, islet antigen-2, or islet cell.

Furthermore, recruitment of the MLL2 complex to the beta-globin locus is dependent upon NF-E2 and coincides spatio-temporally with NF-E2 binding during erythroid differentiation. Thus, a DNA-bound activator is important initially for guiding MLL2 to a particular genomic location. Interestingly, while the MLL2-associated subunit ASH2L is restricted to the beta-globin locus control region 38 kb upstream of the beta(maj)-globin gene, the MLL2 protein spreads across the beta-globin locus, suggesting a previously undefined mechanism by which an activator influences transcription and H3K4 trimethylation at a distance.",8/17/07,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,573-84,,4,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Extracts; Cell Line; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency; DNA Methylation; Erythroid Cells/cytology; Genetic; Globins/*genetics; Histones/metabolism; Methyltransferases/*metabolism; Mice; Models; Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/deficiency/*metabolism; NF-E2 Transcription Factor; Nuclear Proteins/deficiency; p45 Subunit/metabolism; Protein Binding; Protein Transport; Trans-Activators/*metabolism; Transcription; Transcription Factors/deficiency; Tumor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion of the Spt5 CTD or mutation of the Spt5 serines targeted by Bur1 reduces recruitment of the PAF complex, which functions to recruit factors involved in chromatin modification and mRNA maturation to elongating polymerase II (Pol II). Deletion of the Spt5 CTD showed the same defect in PAF recruitment as rapid inhibition of Bur1 kinase activity, and this Spt5 mutation led to a decrease in histone H3K4 trimethylation. Brief inhibition of Bur1 kinase activity in vivo also led to a significant decrease in phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD at Ser-2, showing that Bur1 also contributes to Pol II Ser-2 phosphorylation.

This pathway is highly analogous to the pathways utilized by Fc receptors and integrins to regulate ROS production. Oral infection of mice with serovar Typhimurium demonstrates that the DAP12-dependent pathway regulates cecal colonization during early stages of Salmonella infection.

H.; van den Engh, G.",Chromatic shifts in the fluorescence emitted by murine thymocytes stained with Hoechst 33342,Cytometry A,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cyto.a.20058,,"BACKGROUND: Many methods in flow cytometry rely on staining DNA with a fluorescent dye to gauge DNA content. From the relative intensity of the fluorescence signature, one can then infer position in cell cycle, amount of DNA (i.e., for sperm selection), or, as in the case of flow karyotyping, to distinguish individual chromosomes. This work examines the staining of murine thymocytes with a common DNA dye, Hoechst 33342, to investigate nonlinearities in the florescence intensity as well as chromatic shifts. METHODS: Murine thymocytes were stained with Hoechst 33342 and measured in a flow cytometer at two fluorescence emission bands. In other measurements, cells were stained at different dye concentrations, and then centrifuged. The supernatant was then used for a second round of staining to test the amount of dye uptake. Finally, to test for resonant energy transfer, we measured fluorescence anisotropy at two different wavelengths. RESULTS: The fluorescence of cells stained with Hoechst 33342 is a nonlinear process that shows an overall decrease in intensity with increased dye uptake, and spectral shift to the red. Along with the spectral shift of the fluorescence to the longer wavelengths, we document decreases in the fluorescence anisotropy that may indicate resonant energy transfer. CONCLUSIONS: At low concentrations, Hoechst 33342 binds to the minor groove of DNA and shows an increase in fluorescence and a blue shift upon binding. At higher concentrations, at which the dye molecules can no longer bind without overlapping, the blue fluorescence decreases and the red fluorescence increases until there is approximately one dye molecule per DNA base pair. The ratio of the blue fluorescence to the red fluorescence is an accurate indicator of the cellular dye concentration.",2004-08,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,173-81,,2,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Benzimidazoles/chemistry/metabolism; *Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry/metabolism; Animals; DNA/*metabolism; Flow Cytometry/*instrumentation/methods; Fluorescence Polarization; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Inbred C57BL; Lasers; Mice; Thymus Gland/cytology; T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/cytology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important issue is whether proteasomal degradation of p21 occurs independently of ubiquitylation or, alternatively, whether ubiquitylation on its N terminus is crucial. We resolve this uncertainty by showing that endogenous cellular p21 is completely acetylated at its amino terminus and is therefore not a substrate for N-ubiquitylation. We further show that inactivation of essential components of the ubiquitylation machinery does not directly impact endogenous p21 degradation. Our results underscore the importance of N-acetylation in restricting N-ubiquitylation and show, in particular, that ubiquitylation of endogenous p21 either at internal lysines or on the N terminus is unlikely to control its degradation by the proteasome.",12/3/04,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,839-47,,5,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Gene Expression Regulation; Acetylation; Animals; Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism; Cells; Cultured; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21; Cycloheximide/pharmacology; Fibroblasts/metabolism; Lysine/chemistry; Mice; Plasmids/metabolism; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism; Protein Conformation; Protein Structure; Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology; Retroviridae/genetics; S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/metabolism; Temperature; Tertiary; Time Factors; Transfection; Ubiquitin/*chemistry/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion of p38delta results in pronounced activation of protein kinase D (PKD), the latter of which we have identified as a pivotal regulator of stimulated insulin exocytosis. p38delta catalyzes an inhibitory phosphorylation of PKD1, thereby attenuating stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, p38delta null mice are protected against high-fat-feeding-induced insulin resistance and oxidative stress-mediated beta cell failure. Inhibition of PKD1 reverses enhanced insulin secretion from p38delta-deficient islets and glucose tolerance in p38delta null mice as well as their susceptibility to oxidative stress.

Although toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways have been implicated in the recognition of several classes of pro-inflammatory microbes, it is not known if pathogens with anti-inflammatory properties activate the host response through this family of proteins. In this study, Leishmania major stimulation of cytokine promoter-luciferase reporter constructs was examined in transfected macrophages to detect early signs of cellular activation. L. major selectively activated the promoter region of IL-1 alpha, but not IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, or an NF-kappa B reporter. IL-1 alpha mRNA expression was also stimulated by L. major, although at lower levels than lipopolysacharide-stimulated macrophages. No IL-1 alpha protein was detectable in stimulated cell lysates or culture supernatants. Transfection of macrophages with a dominant-negative version of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), an adaptor protein which interacts with TLRs, inhibited activation of the IL-1 alpha promoter. Furthermore, stimulation of IL-1 alpha RNA expression by L. major was inhibited in peritoneal macrophages from MyD88-/- as compared to MyD88+/+ mice. These observations indicate that L. major stimulates IL-1 alpha promoter activity and mRNA expression in macrophages through MyD88-dependent pathways. However, additional anti-inflammatory pathways must also be activated which downregulate transcription and ultimately inhibit translation of the IL-1 alpha protein. Examination of promoter activation is a powerful tool for understanding the early events in macrophage activation for anti-inflammatory pathogens such as Leishmania that have mechanisms to downregulate transcription and translation.",2002-07,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,763-71,,8,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Gene Expression Regulation; *Signal Transduction; Adaptor Proteins; Animals; Antigens; Cell Line; Differentiation/*metabolism; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Genes; Genetic/genetics; Immunologic/*metabolism; Interleukin-1/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics; Leishmania major/*physiology; Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology; Macrophage Activation/drug effects; Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism/parasitology; Messenger/genetics/metabolism; Mice; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Promoter Regions; Receptors; Reporter/genetics; RNA; Signal Transducing; Transfection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The result is that unrelated individuals end up impacting each othersâ€°Ã›Âª fitness directly through their metabolic activities.

Flow cytometric, biochemical, (1)(4)C radioisotope tracing assays, and global transcriptomic analyses show that organic algal photosynthate released by Dunalliela salina cells undergoing PCD complements the nutritional needs of other non-PCD D. salina cells. This occurs in vitro in a carbon limited environment and enhances the growth of the population. In addition, a co-occurring heterotroph Halobacterium salinarum re-mineralizes the carbon providing elemental nutrients for the mixoheterotrophic chlorophyte. The significance of this is uncertain and the archaeon can also subsist entirely on the lysate of apoptotic algae. PCD is now well established in unicellular organisms; however its ecological relevance has been difficult to decipher. In this study we found that PCD in D. salina causes the release of organic nutrients such as glycerol, which can be used by others in the population as well as a co-occurring halophilic archaeon. H. salinarum also re-mineralizes the dissolved material promoting algal growth. PCD in D. salina was the mechanism for the flow of dissolved photosynthate between unrelated organisms.

These linkages are regulated by the conserved Aurora B/Ipl1 kinase to ensure that sister chromatids are properly attached to spindle microtubules. Kinetochore-microtubule attachments require the essential Ndc80 complex, which contains two globular ends linked by large coiled-coil domains. In this study, we isolated a novel ndc80 mutant in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that contains mutations in the coiled-coil domain. This ndc80 mutant accumulates erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments, resulting in misalignment of kinetochores on the mitotic spindle. Genetic analyses with suppressors of the ndc80 mutant and in vitro cross-linking experiments suggest that the kinetochore misalignment in vivo stems from a defect in the ability of the Ndc80 complex to stably fold at a hinge in the coiled coil. Previous studies proposed that the Ndc80 complex can exist in multiple conformations: elongated during metaphase and bent during anaphase. However, the distinct functions of individual conformations in vivo are unknown. Here, our analysis revealed a tightly folded conformation of the Ndc80 complex that is likely required early in mitosis. This conformation is mediated by a direct, intracomplex interaction and involves a greater degree of folding than the bent form of the complex at anaphase. Furthermore, our results suggest that this conformation is functionally important in vivo for efficient error correction by Aurora B/Ipl1 and, consequently, to ensure proper kinetochore alignment early in mitosis.",2014-12,2/5/16 22:15,2/9/16 0:19,,1483-1493,,4,198,,Genetics,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 25230952 PMCID: PMC4256767,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230952,,"Alleles; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Substitution; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Hec1; Kinetochores; linker scanning; mass spectrometry; Microtubules; Mitosis; Models, Biological; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Nuclear Proteins; optical trap; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Protein Folding; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Sequence Alignment; syntelic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A description of allowable metabolic network functions can be obtained using extreme pathways, which are the convex basis vectors of the solution space containing all steady state flux distributions. However, only a portion of these allowable network functions are physiologically possible due to kinetic and regulatory constraints. Methods are now needed that enable us to take a defined metabolic network and deduce candidate regulatory structures that control the selection of these physiologically relevant states. One such approach is the singular value decomposition (SVD) of extreme pathway matrices (P), which allows for the characterization of steady state solution spaces. Eigenpathways, which are the left singular vectors from the SVD of P, can be described and categorized by their biochemical function. SVD of P for the human red blood cell showed that the first five eigenpathways, out of a total of 23, effectively characterize all the relevant physiological states of red blood cell metabolism calculated with a detailed kinetic model. Thus, with five degrees of freedom the magnitude and nature of the regulatory needs are defined. Additionally, the dominant features of these first five eigenpathways described key metabolic splits that are indeed regulated in the human red blood cell. The extreme pathway matrix is derived directly from network topology and only knowledge of Vmax values is needed to reach these conclusions. Thus, we have implemented a network-based analysis of regulation that complements the study of individual regulatory events.

Despite the arguably better dynamic range obtainable with ESI, MALDI is increasingly popular due to ease of use, ruggedness and the ability to decouple separation from ionization. By contrast, in order to take advantage of the sensitivity and dynamic range afforded by the concentration-dependent nature of ESI, it is directly coupled to separations that take place in small i.d. RP-microLC columns. This gain in sensitivity often comes at a loss of ruggedness due to clogging of the small i.d. RP-microLC columns, one result of which is limited sample throughput. Here we describe a combined micropre-column-microLC-ESI device that is sensitive, rugged and modular in design allowing facile construction and troubleshooting. Due to low signal-to-noise as little as 1 attomole of a peptide can be selected by data-dependent methods for collision-induced dissociation. Importantly, the resulting tandem mass spectrum is of high enough quality to identify the peptide sequence by a database search against a complex database using SEQUEST. Finally, the device is demonstrated to be rugged as judged by >60 consecutive reversed-phase microLC separations on complex peptide mixtures before chromatographic resolution is degraded.",2003,9/14/15 19:01,2/9/16 0:19,,2093-8,,18,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Angiotensin I/analysis/chemistry; Autoanalysis/instrumentation/methods; Chromatography; Electrospray Ionization/*instrumentation/*methods; High Pressure Liquid/*instrumentation/*methods; Mass; Neurotensin/analysis/chemistry; Peptides/*analysis/*chemistry; Spectrometry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the first observation of light-dark (LD)-entrained diurnal oscillatory transcription in up to 12% of all genes of a halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1. Significantly, the diurnally entrained transcription was observed under constant darkness after removal of the LD stimulus (free-running rhythms). The memory of diurnal entrainment was also associated with the synchronization of oxic and anoxic physiologies to the LD cycle.

Mineralization is characterized by apatite deposition on collagen fibrils and the presence of matrix vesicles, as has been described in calcified vascular lesions in vivo as well as in bone and teeth. In the present study, we used this model to investigate the molecular mechanisms driving vascular calcification. We found that BASMCs lost their lineage markers, SM22alpha and smooth muscle alpha-actin, within 10 days of being placed under calcifying conditions. Conversely, the cells gained an osteogenic phenotype as indicated by an increase in expression and DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor, core binding factor alpha1 (Cbfa1). Moreover, genes containing the Cbfa1 binding site, OSE2, including osteopontin, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase were elevated. The relevance of these in vitro findings to vascular calcification in vivo was further studied in matrix GLA protein null (MGP(-/-)) mice whose arteries spontaneously calcify. We found that arterial calcification was associated with a similar loss in smooth muscle markers and a gain of osteopontin and Cbfa1 expression. These data demonstrate a novel association of vascular calcification with smooth muscle cell phenotypic transition, in which several osteogenic proteins including osteopontin, osteocalcin, and the bone determining factor Cbfa1 are gained.

Mapping out these tissue-specific functions in genome-scale models will advance our understanding of the metabolic basis of various physiological and pathological processes. The global knowledgebase of metabolic functions categorized for the human genome (Human Recon 1) coupled with abundant high-throughput data now makes possible the reconstruction of tissue-specific metabolic models. However, the number of available tissue-specific models remains incomplete compared with the large diversity of human tissues. RESULTS: We developed a method called metabolic Context-specificity Assessed by Deterministic Reaction Evaluation (mCADRE). mCADRE is able to infer a tissue-specific network based on gene expression data and metabolic network topology, along with evaluation of functional capabilities during model building. mCADRE produces models with similar or better functionality and achieves dramatic computational speed up over existing methods. Using our method, we reconstructed draft genome-scale metabolic models for 126 human tissue and cell types. Among these, there are models for 26 tumor tissues along with their normal counterparts, and 30 different brain tissues. We performed pathway-level analyses of this large collection of tissue-specific models and identified the eicosanoid metabolic pathway, especially reactions catalyzing the production of leukotrienes from arachidnoic acid, as potential drug targets that selectively affect tumor tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This large collection of 126 genome-scale draft metabolic models provides a useful resource for studying the metabolic basis for a variety of human diseases across many tissues. The functionality of the resulting models and the fast computational speed of the mCADRE algorithm make it a useful tool to build and update tissue-specific metabolic models.",2012,2/8/16 23:45,2/9/16 0:19,,,,,6,,BMC Syst Biol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,"*Metabolic Networks and Pathways; *Models, Biological; *Transcriptome; Genomics/*methods; Humans; Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism; Organ Specificity; Time Factors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accurate segregation requires that kinetochores make bioriented attachments to microtubules from opposite poles. Attachments between kinetochores and microtubules are monitored by the spindle checkpoint, a surveillance system that prevents anaphase until every pair of chromosomes makes proper bioriented attachments. Checkpoint activity is correlated with the recruitment of checkpoint proteins to the kinetochore. Mps1 is a conserved protein kinase that regulates segregation and the spindle checkpoint, but few of the targets that mediate its functions have been identified. Here, we show that Mps1 is the major kinase activity that copurifies with budding yeast kinetochore particles and identify the conserved Spc105/KNL-1/blinkin kinetochore protein as a substrate. Phosphorylation of conserved MELT motifs within Spc105 recruits the Bub1 protein to kinetochores, and this is reversed by protein phosphatase I (PP1). Spc105 mutants lacking Mps1 phosphorylation sites are defective in the spindle checkpoint and exhibit growth defects.

We examined the role of TLR polymorphisms in conferring a risk of invasive aspergillosis among recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplants. METHODS: We analyzed 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the toll-like receptor 2 gene (TLR2), the toll-like receptor 3 gene (TLR3), the toll-like receptor 4 gene (TLR4), and the toll-like receptor 9 gene (TLR9) in a cohort of 336 recipients of hematopoietic-cell transplants and their unrelated donors. The risk of invasive aspergillosis was assessed with the use of multivariate Cox regression analysis. The analysis was replicated in a validation study involving 103 case patients and 263 matched controls who received hematopoietic-cell transplants from related and unrelated donors. RESULTS: In the discovery study, two donor TLR4 haplotypes (S3 and S4) increased the risk of invasive aspergillosis (adjusted hazard ratio for S3, 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 4.25; P=0.02; adjusted hazard ratio for S4, 6.16; 95% CI, 1.97 to 19.26; P=0.002).

In the discovery study, seropositivity for cytomegalovirus (CMV) in donors or recipients, donor positivity for S4, or both, as compared with negative results for CMV and S4, were associated with an increase in the 3-year probability of invasive aspergillosis (12% vs. 1%, P=0.02) and death that was not related to relapse (35% vs. 22%, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an association between the donor TLR4 haplotype S4 and the risk of invasive aspergillosis among recipients of hematopoietic-cell transplants from unrelated donors.",10/23/08,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,1766-77,,17,359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality; *Polymorphism; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Aspergillosis/*genetics; Aspergillus fumigatus; Case-Control Studies; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Haplotypes; Homologous; Humans; Incidence; Linkage Disequilibrium; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Assessment; Single Nucleotide; Toll-Like Receptor 4/*genetics; Toll-Like Receptors/genetics; Transplantation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AR can act either as a promoter or a tumor suppressor depending on cell types. The AR proliferative response program has been well studied, but its prohibitive response program has not yet been thoroughly studied. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Previous studies found that PC3 cells expressing the wild-type AR inhibit growth and suppress invasion. We applied expression profiling to identify the response program of PC3 cells expressing the AR (PC3-AR) under different growth conditions (i.e. with or without androgens and at different concentration of androgens) and then applied the newly developed ChIP-seq technology to identify the AR binding regions in the PC3 cancers genome. A surprising finding was that the comparison of MOCK-transfected PC3 cells with AR-transfected cells identified 3,452 differentially expressed genes (two fold cutoff) even without the addition of androgens (i.e. in ethanol control), suggesting that a ligand independent activation or extremely low-level androgen activation of the AR. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed 6,629 AR binding regions in the cancers genome of PC3 cells with an FDR (false discovery rate) cut off of 0.05. About 22.4% (638 of 2,849) can be mapped to within 2 kb of the transcription start site (TSS). Three novel AR binding motifs were identified in the AR binding regions of PC3-AR cells, and two of them share a core consensus sequence CGAGCTCTTC, which together mapped to 27.3% of AR binding regions (1,808/6,629). In contrast, only about 2.9% (190/6,629) of AR binding sites contains the canonical AR matrix M00481, M00447 and M00962 (from the Transfac database), which is derived mostly from AR proliferative responsive genes in androgen dependent cells. In addition, we identified four top ranking co-occupancy transcription factors in the AR binding regions, which include TEF1 (Transcriptional enhancer factor), GATA (GATA transcription factors), OCT (octamer transcription factors) and PU1 (PU.1 transcription factor). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data provide a valuable data set in understanding the molecular basis for growth inhibition response program of the AR in prostate cancers cells, which can be exploited for developing novel prostate cancers therapeutic strategies.",2009,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,e6589,,8,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Androgen/metabolism/ physiology; Cell Line; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Chromosomes; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Profiling; Human; Humans; Male; Pair 22; Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/ pathology; Protein Binding; Receptors; Tumor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although its role in chromatid cohesion is well established, the functional significance of cohesinâ€°Ã›Âªs association with interphase chromatin is not clear. Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we show that the STAG1 (Scc3/SA1) subunit of cohesin interacts with the CCTC-binding factor CTCF bound to the c-myc insulator element. Both allele-specific binding of CTCF and Scc3/SA1 at the imprinted IGF2/H19 gene locus and our analyses of human DM1 alleles containing base substitutions at CTCF-binding motifs indicate that cohesin recruitment to chromosomal sites depends on the presence of CTCF. A large-scale genomic survey using ChIP-Chip demonstrates that Scc3/SA1 binding strongly correlates with the CTCF-binding site distribution in chromosomal arms. However, some chromosomal sites interact exclusively with CTCF, whereas others interact with Scc3/SA1 only. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy and ChIP-Chip experiments demonstrate that CTCF associates with both centromeres and chromosomal arms during metaphase. These results link cohesin to gene regulatory functions and suggest an essential role for CTCF during sister chromatid cohesion. These results have implications for the functional role of cohesin subunits in the pathogenesis of Cornelia de Lange syndrome and Roberts syndromes.",6/17/08,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,8309-14,,24,105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3T3 Cells; Alleles; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Centromere/*metabolism; Chromatin/genetics/*metabolism; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Chromosomal Proteins; Chromosomes; DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Genomic Imprinting; Genomics; Human/metabolism; Humans; Insulator Elements; Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/genetics; Jurkat Cells; Mass Spectrometry; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Non-Histone/genetics/*metabolism; Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Proteomics; Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using whole-genome sequencing in a cohort of 11Ã¥ÃŠfamilies lacking mutations in the four genes with known roles in AOS pathology (ARHGAP31, RBPJ, DOCK6, and EOGT), we found a heterozygous de novo 85 kb deletion spanning the NOTCH1 5' region and three coding variants (c.1285T>C [p.Cys429Arg], c.4487G>A [p.Cys1496Tyr], and c.5965G>A [p.Asp1989Asn]), two of which are de novo, in four unrelated probands. In a fifth family, we identified a heterozygous canonical splice-site variant (c.743-1 G>T) in an affected father and daughter. These variants were not present in 5,077 in-house control genomes or in public databases. In keeping with the prominent developmental role described for Notch1 in mouse vasculature, we observed cardiac and multiple vascular defects in four of the five families.

The networks can be simulated using stochastic techniques that model each reaction as a stochastic event. As models become increasingly large and sophisticated, however, the solution time can become excessive; particularly if one wishes to determine the effect on noise of changes to a series of parameters, or the model structure. Methods are therefore required to rapidly estimate stochastic noise. RESULTS: This paper presents an algorithm, based on error growth techniques from non-linear dynamics, to rapidly estimate the noise characteristics of genetic networks of arbitrary size. The method can also be used to determine analytical solutions for simple sub-systems. It is demonstrated on a number of cases, including a prototype model of the galactose regulatory pathway in yeast.

Nonetheless, both of them predict that the highly nonlinear dynamics exhibited by genetic regulatory systems can be characterized into two broad regimes, to wit, an ordered regime where the system is robust against perturbations, and a chaotic regime where the system is extremely sensitive to perturbations. It has been a plausible and long-standing hypothesis that genomic regulatory networks of real cells operate in the ordered regime or at the border between order and chaos. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by the robustness and stability observed in the phenotypic traits of living organisms under genetic perturbations. However, there has been no systematic study to determine whether the gene-expression patterns of real cells are compatible with the dynamically ordered regimes predicted by theoretical models. Using the Boolean approach, here we show what we believe to be the first direct evidence that the underlying genetic network of HeLa cells appears to operate either in the ordered regime or at the border between order and chaos but does not appear to be chaotic.",9/20/05,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,13439-44,,38,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Gene Expression Regulation; *Models; *Systems Biology/methods; Genetic; Hela Cells; Humans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structural analysis reveals that the main structural change that accommodates different anions is the repositioning of the polar side chain of S85. On the basis of these X-ray crystal structures, the prediction is then made that the D85S/D212N double mutant might bind similar anions and do so over a broader pH range than does the single mutant.

These transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) have been mathematically described using a Boolean formalism, in which the state of a gene is represented as either transcribed or not transcribed in response to regulatory signals. The Boolean formalism results in a series of regulatory rules for the individual genes of a TRN that in turn can be used to link environmental cues to the transcription state of a genome, thereby forming a complete transcriptional regulatory system (TRS). Herein, we develop a formalism that represents such a set of regulatory rules in a matrix form. Matrix formalism allows for the systemic characterization of the properties of a TRS and facilitates the computation of the transcriptional state of the genome under any given set of environmental conditions. Additionally, it provides a means to incorporate mechanistic detail of a TRS as it becomes available.

",,"Cells have evolved biomolecular networks that process and respond to changing chemical environments. Understanding how complex protein interactions give rise to emergent network properties requires time-resolved analysis of cellular response under a large number of genetic perturbations and chemical environments. To date, the lack of technologies for scalable cell analysis under well-controlled and time-varying conditions has made such global studies either impossible or impractical. To address this need, we have developed a high-throughput microfluidic imaging platform for single-cell studies of network response under hundreds of combined genetic perturbations and time-varying stimulant sequences. Our platform combines programmable on-chip mixing and perfusion with high-throughput image acquisition and processing to perform 256 simultaneous time-lapse live-cell imaging experiments. Nonadherent cells are captured in an array of 2,048 microfluidic cell traps to allow for the imaging of eight different genotypes over 12 h and in response to 32 unique sequences of stimulation, generating a total of 49,000 images per run. Using 12 devices, we carried out >3,000 live-cell imaging experiments to investigate the mating pheromone response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under combined genetic perturbations and changing environmental conditions. Comprehensive analysis of 11 deletion mutants reveals both distinct thresholds for morphological switching and new dynamic phenotypes that are not observed in static conditions. For example, kss1Delta, fus3Delta, msg5Delta, and ptp2Delta mutants exhibit distinctive stimulus-frequency-dependent signaling phenotypes, implicating their role in filtering and network memory. The combination of parallel microfluidic control with high-throughput imaging provides a powerful tool for systems-level studies of single-cell decision making.",3/10/09,9/14/15 19:03,2/9/16 0:19,,3758-63,,10,106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects; Imaging; Microfluidics/*instrumentation; Mutation/genetics; Peptides/pharmacology; Phenotype; Pheromones/pharmacology; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*cytology/drug effects/*enzymology/physiology; Three-Dimensional/*instrumentation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Naproxen treatment was highly effective in general, inducing a symptom-free status in 43% of our patients after 6 months. However, four nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) partial-responders were additionally treated with sulfasalazine and short-term corticosteroids. The total number of clinical detectable lesions was significantly reduced. Mean disease activity estimated by the patient/physician and the physical aspect of health-related quality of life including functional ability (global assessment/childhood health assessment questionnaire and childhood health assessment questionnaire) and pain improved significantly. Forty-one percent of our patients showed radiological relapses, but 67% of them were clinically silent. CONCLUSIONS: Most children show a favorable clinical course in the first year of anti-inflammatory treatment with NSAIDs. Relapses and new radiological lesions can occur at any time and at any site in the skeleton but may not be clinically symptomatic.

Here we show that the GPCR kinase-interacting protein-1 (GIT1) is a substrate for c-Src that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to angiotensin II (AngII) and EGF in vascular smooth muscle and 293 cells. GIT1 associates with PLCgamma via the PLCgamma Src homology 2 and 3 domains constitutively, and the interaction is unaltered by AngII and EGF. GIT1 interaction with PLCgamma is required for PLCgamma activation based on inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium mobilization after GIT1 knockdown with antisense GIT1 oligonucleotides. GIT1 interacts with PLCgamma via a novel Spa homology domain (SHD) and a coiled-coil domain. Deletion mutation analysis showed that GIT1(SHD) is required for AngII- and EGF-mediated PLCgamma activation (measured by phosphorylation of Tyr783 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation). We propose that GIT1 is a novel regulator of PLCgamma function that mediates PLCgamma activation by c-Src and integrates signal transduction by GPCRs and TKRs.",12/12/03,9/14/15 19:02,2/9/16 0:19,,49936-44,,50,278,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Cell Cycle Proteins; *Phosphoproteins; *Signal Transduction; Adaptor Proteins; Amino Acid; Amino Acid Sequence; Angiotensin II/*metabolism; Animals; Biological; Calcium/metabolism; Cell Line; Cells; Cloning; Cultured; DNA Mutational Analysis; Enzyme Activation; Epidermal Growth Factor/*metabolism; Gene Deletion; Genetic; GTPase-Activating Proteins/*physiology; Humans; Immunoblotting; Mass Spectrometry; Models; Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Muscle; Oligonucleotides/metabolism; Peptides/chemistry; Phospholipase C gamma; Phosphorylation; Plasmids/metabolism; Precipitin Tests; Protein Binding; Protein Structure; Rats; Sequence Homology; Signal Transducing; Smooth/cytology; src-Family Kinases/*metabolism; Tertiary; Transfection; Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism; Tyrosine/metabolism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 4E-BPs inhibit translation in a reversible manner. Hypophosphorylated 4E-BPs interact avidly with eIF4E, whereas 4E-BP hyperphosphorylation, elicited by stimulation of cells with hormones, cytokines, or growth factors, results in an abrogation of eIF4E-binding activity.

Recently researchers developed the quasi-potential theory to represent the Waddington's landscape. The Quasi-potential U(x), derived from interactions in the gene regulatory network (GRN) of a cell, quantifies the relative stability of network states, which determine the effort required for state transitions in a multi-stable dynamical system. However, quasi-potential landscapes, originally developed for continuous systems, are not suitable for discrete-valued networks which are important tools to study complex systems. In this paper, we provide a framework to quantify the landscape for discrete Boolean networks (BNs). We apply our framework to study pancreas cell differentiation where an ensemble of BN models is considered based on the structure of a minimal GRN for pancreas development. We impose biologically motivated structural constraints (corresponding to specific type of Boolean functions) and dynamical constraints (corresponding to stable attractor states) to limit the space of BN models for pancreas development. In addition, we enforce a novel functional constraint corresponding to the relative ordering of attractor states in BN models to restrict the space of BN models to the biological relevant class. We find that BNs with canalyzing/sign-compatible Boolean functions best capture the dynamics of pancreas cell differentiation.

Due to the availability of increasingly less expensive generation of whole genome sequencing information, genetic studies are able to collect data for more families and from large family cohorts with the goal of improving statistical power. However, due to missing genotypes, many families are not included in the family based association tests, negating the benefits of large scale sequencing data. Here, we present the CIFBAT method to use incomplete families in Family Based Association Test (FBAT) to evaluate robustness against missing data. CIFBAT uses quantile intervals of the FBAT statistic by randomly choosing valid completions of incomplete family genotypes based on Mendelian inheritance rules. By considering all valid completions equally likely and computing quantile intervals over many randomized iterations, CIFBAT avoids assumption of a homogeneous population structure or any particular missingness pattern in the data. Using simulated data, we show that the quantile intervals computed by CIFBAT are useful in validating robustness of the FBAT statistic against missing data and in identifying genomic markers with higher precision.

To investigate the dynamic changes in transcription during different growth phases and starvation, we analyzed the single-cell transcriptional dynamics of the E. coli lac promoter. Cells were grown under different starvation conditions, including glucose, magnesium, phosphate and thiamine limitations, and transcription dynamics was quantified using a single RNA detection method at different phases. Differences in gene expression over conditions and phases indicate that stochasticity in transcription dynamics is directly connected to cell phase and availability of nutrients. Except for glucose, the pattern of transcription dynamics under all starvation conditions appears to be similar. Transcriptional bursts were more prominent in lag and stationary phase cells starved for energy sources. Identical behavior was observed in exponential phase cells starved for phosphate and thiamine. Noise measurements under all nutrient exhaustion conditions indicate that intrinsic noise is higher than extrinsic noise.

This simple circuit can generate multistability and explains the symmetric ""poised"" precursor state in which both factors are present in the cell at equal amounts as well as the resolution of this indeterminate state as the cell commits to either cell fate characterized by an asymmetric expression pattern of the two factors. This establishes the two alternative stable attractors that represent the two fate options. It has been debated whether cooperativity of molecular interactions is necessary to produce such multistability. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we take a general modeling approach and argue that this question is not relevant. We show that non-linearity can arise in two distinct models in which no explicit interaction between the two factors is assumed and that distinct chemical reaction kinetic formalisms can lead to the same (generic) dynamical system form.

This ""arrow of time"" in the collective change of gene expression across multiple stable gene expression patterns (attractors) is not explained by the regulated activation, the suppression of individual genes which are bidirectional molecular processes, or by the standard dynamical models of the underlying gene circuit which only account for local stability of attractors. To capture the global dynamics of this nonequilibrium system and gain insight in the time-asymmetry of state transitions, we computed the quasipotential landscape of the stochastic dynamics of a canonical gene circuit that governs branching cell fate commitment. The potential landscape reveals the global dynamics and permits the calculation of potential barriers between cell phenotypes imposed by the circuit architecture. The generic asymmetry of barrier heights indicates that the transition from the uncommitted multipotent state to differentiated states is inherently unidirectional.

Cardiovascular Genetics,,1942-3268,http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.108.806935,,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac hypertrophy is classically regarded as a compensatory response, yet the active tissue remodeling processes triggered by various types of mechanical stress can enhance or diminish the function of the heart. Despite the disparity in outcomes, there are similarities in the hypertrophic responses. We hypothesized that a generic genetic response that is not dependent on the particular nature of the hypertrophic stimulus exists. To test our hypothesis, we compared the temporal evolution of transcriptomes measured in hearts subjected to either adaptive (exercise-induced) or maladaptive (aortic banding-induced) hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Generic hypertrophy-associated genes were identified and distinguished from stimulus-dependent transcripts by coupling a metric of cardiac growth with a dynamic time-warping algorithm to align transcriptome changes with respect to the hypertrophy response. The major differences in expression between the adaptive and maladaptive hypertrophy models were centered around the genes involved in metabolism, fibrosis, and immune response. Conversely, transcripts with common expression patterns in both hypertrophy models were associated with signal transduction, cytoskeletal development, and muscle contraction. Thus, despite the apparent differences in the expression response of the heart to either athletic conditioning or pressure overload, there is a set of genes that displays similar expression profiles. CONCLUSIONS: This finding lends support to the notion of a generalized cardiac growth mechanism that is activated in response to mechanical perturbation. The common and unique genetic signatures of adaptive and maladaptive hypertrophy may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of pathological myocardial remodeling.",2009-04,5/9/16 18:34,5/9/16 20:37,,116-124,,2,2,,Circ Cardiovasc Genet,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 20031575 PMCID: PMC2731432,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20031575,,"Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Cardiomegaly; Gene Expression Profiling; Heart; Humans; Mice; Myocardium; Signal Transduction; Time Factors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efforts to understand cell fate control have focused on simple gene regulatory circuits that predict the presence of multiple stable states, bifurcations and switch-like transitions. However, existing gene network models do not explain more complex properties of cell fate dynamics such as the hierarchical branching of developmental paths. Here, we construct a generic minimal model of the genetic regulatory network controlling cell fate determination, which exhibits five elementary characteristics of cell differentiation: stability, directionality, branching, exclusivity, and promiscuous expression. We argue that a modular architecture comprising repeated network elements reproduces these features of differentiation by sequentially repressing selected modules and hence restricting the dynamics to lower dimensional subspaces of the high-dimensional state space. We implement our model both with ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to explore the role of bifurcations in producing the one-way character of differentiation, and with stochastic differential equations (SDEs), to demonstrate the effect of noise on the system. We further argue that binary cell fate decisions are prevalent in cell differentiation due to general features of the underlying dynamical system.

Moreover, these diseases are also a major financial burden worldwide, significantly impacting the economy of many countries. Healthcare systems and medicine have progressively improved upon the ability to address infectious diseases and react to adverse health events through both surgical interventions and pharmacology; we have become efficient in delivering reactive care (i.e., initiating interventions once an individual is on the verge of or has actually suffered a negative health event). However, with slowly progressing and often 'silent' chronic diseases now being the main cause of illness, healthcare and medicine must evolve into a proactive system, moving away from a merely reactive approach to care. Minimal interactions among the specialists and limited information to the general practitioner and to the individual receiving care lead to a fragmented health approach, non-concerted prescriptions, a scattered follow-up and a suboptimal cost-effectiveness ratio. A new approach in medicine that is predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory, which we label here as ""P4"" holds great promise to reduce the burden of chronic diseases by harnessing technology and an increasingly better understanding of environment-biology interactions, evidence-based interventions and the underlying mechanisms of chronic diseases. In this concept paper, we propose a 'P4 Health Continuum' model as a framework to promote and facilitate multi-stakeholder collaboration with an orchestrated common language and an integrated care model to increase the healthspan.",2016,9/12/16 17:22,9/12/16 19:26,,,,,,,Prog Cardiovasc Dis,,,,,,,,ENG,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 27546358,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27546358,,Allostasis; Allostatic load; Exercise; Healthspan; Nutrition; P4 medicine; Systems Biology; systems medicine; Wellness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results are consistent with previously predicted roles for the Tfb2 Hub, Ssl2 Lock and Tfb3 Latch regions, with mutations in these elements typically having severe defects in TFIIH subunit association. We also found unexpected roles for other domains whose function had not previously been defined. First, the Ssl1-Tfb4 Ring domains are important for TFIIH assembly. Second, the Tfb2 Hub and HEAT domains have an unexpected role in association with Tfb3. Third, the Tfb3 Ring domain is important for association with many other TFIIH subunits. Fourth, a partial deletion of the Ssl1 NTE domain inhibits TFIIH function without affecting subunit association.

Resistance to standard radiation and chemotherapy is thought to involve survival of GBM cancer stem cells (CSCs). To date, no single marker for identifying GBM CSCs has been able to capture the diversity of CSC populations, justifying the needs for additional CSC markers for better characterization. Employing targeted mass spectrometry, here we present five cell-surface markers HMOX1, SLC16A1, CADM1, SCAMP3, and CLCC1 which were found to be elevated in CSCs relative to healthy neural stem cells (NSCs). Transcriptomic analyses of REMBRANDT and TCGA compendiums also indicated elevated expression of these markers in GBM relative to controls and non-GBM diseases. Two markers SLC16A1 and HMOX1 were found to be expressed among pseudopalisading cells that reside in the hypoxic region of GBM, substantiating the histopathological hallmarks of GBM. In a prospective study (Nâ€‰=â€‰8) we confirmed the surface expression of HMOX1 on freshly isolated primary GBM cells (P0). Employing functional assays that are known to evaluate stemness, we demonstrate that elevated HMOX1 expression is associated with stemness in GBM and can be modulated through TGFÎ². siRNA-mediated silencing of HMOX1 impaired GBM invasion-a phenomenon related to poor prognosis. In addition, surgical resection of GBM tumors caused declines (18%â€‰Â±â€‰5.1SEM) in the level of plasma HMOX1 as measured by ELISA, in 8/10 GBM patients. These findings indicate that HMOX1 is a robust predictor of GBM CSC stemness and pathogenesis. Further understanding of the role of HMOX1 in GBM may uncover novel therapeutic approaches.

To better understand its anti-tumor mechanism, we utilized a spontaneous metastatic mouse model and quantitative proteomics to compare N-glycoproteome changes in 94 serum samples with and without treatment. We quantified 231 highly confident N-glycosylated proteins using iTRAQ shotgun proteomics. Among them, 53 showed significantly discriminated regulatory patterns over the time course, in which the acute phase response emerged as the most enhanced pathway. The anti-tumor feature of the acute response was further investigated using parallel reaction monitoring target proteomics and flow cytometry on 23 of the 53 significant proteins. We found that cryo-thermal therapy reset the tumor chronic inflammation to an ""acute"" phenotype, with up-regulation of acute phase proteins including IL-6 as a key regulator. The IL-6 mediated ""acute"" phenotype transformed IL-4 and Treg-promoting ICOSL expression to Th1-promoting IFN-Î³ and IL-12 production, augmented complement system activation and CD86(+)MHCII(+) dendritic cells maturation and enhanced the proliferation of Th1 memory cells.

Moreover, cryo-thermal on tumors induced the strongest ""acute"" response compared to cryo/hyperthermia alone or cryo-thermal on healthy tissues, accompanying by the most pronounced anti-tumor immunological effect.

The integration of such complex and heterogeneous Big Data from multiple sources offers unparalleled opportunities to study the early stages of prevalent neurodegenerative processes, track their progression and quickly identify the efficacies of alternative treatments. Many previous human and animal studies have examined the relationship of Parkinson's disease (PD) risk to trauma, genetics, environment, co-morbidities, or life style. The defining characteristics of Big Data-large size, incongruency, incompleteness, complexity, multiplicity of scales, and heterogeneity of information-generating sources-all pose challenges to the classical techniques for data management, processing, visualization and interpretation. We propose, implement, test and validate complementary model-based and model-free approaches for PD classification and prediction. To explore PD risk using Big Data methodology, we jointly processed complex PPMI imaging, genetics, clinical and demographic data. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Collective representation of the multi-source data facilitates the aggregation and harmonization of complex data elements. This enables joint modeling of the complete data, leading to the development of Big Data analytics, predictive synthesis, and statistical validation. Using heterogeneous PPMI data, we developed a comprehensive protocol for end-to-end data characterization, manipulation, processing, cleaning, analysis and validation. Specifically, we (i) introduce methods for rebalancing imbalanced cohorts, (ii) utilize a wide spectrum of classification methods to generate consistent and powerful phenotypic predictions, and (iii) generate reproducible machine-learning based classification that enables the reporting of model parameters and diagnostic forecasting based on new data. We evaluated several complementary model-based predictive approaches, which failed to generate accurate and reliable diagnostic predictions. However, the results of several machine-learning based classification methods indicated significant power to predict Parkinson's disease in the PPMI subjects (consistent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity exceeding 96%, confirmed using statistical n-fold cross-validation). Clinical (e.g., Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores), demographic (e.g., age), genetics (e.g., rs34637584, chr12), and derived neuroimaging biomarker (e.g., cerebellum shape index) data all contributed to the predictive analytics and diagnostic forecasting. CONCLUSIONS: Model-free Big Data machine learning-based classification methods (e.g., adaptive boosting, support vector machines) can outperform model-based techniques in terms of predictive precision and reliability (e.g., forecasting patient diagnosis). We observed that statistical rebalancing of cohort sizes yields better discrimination of group differences, specifically for predictive analytics based on heterogeneous and incomplete PPMI data. UPDRS scores play a critical role in predicting diagnosis, which is expected based on the clinical definition of Parkinson's disease. Even without longitudinal UPDRS data, however, the accuracy of model-free machine learning based classification is over 80%. The methods, software and protocols developed here are openly shared and can be employed to study other neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as well as for other predictive Big Data analytics applications.",2016,9/12/16 17:24,9/12/16 17:24,,e0157077,,8,11,,PLoS ONE,Predictive Big Data Analytics,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 27494614 PMCID: PMC4975403,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27494614,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that MTB can tolerate drug treatment by adopting a tolerant state that can be deciphered through systems analysis of its transcriptional responses. Specifically, we demonstrate how treatment with the antitubercular drug bedaquiline activates a regulatory network that coordinates multiple resistance mechanisms to push MTB into a tolerant state. Disruption of this network, by knocking out its predicted transcription factors, Rv0324 and Rv0880, significantly increased bedaquiline killing and enabled the discovery of a second drug, pretomanid, that potentiated killing by bedaquiline. We demonstrate that the synergistic effect of this combination emerges, in part, through disruption of the tolerance network. We discuss how this network strategy also predicts drug combinations with antagonistic interactions, potentially accelerating the discovery of new effective combination drug regimens for tuberculosis.",2016,9/12/16 17:22,9/12/16 17:22,,16078,,8,1,,Nat Microbiol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 27573104 PMCID: PMC5010021,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27573104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, while there are many relevant vocabularies for the annotation of a dataset, none sufficiently captures all the necessary metadata. This prevents uniform indexing and querying of dataset repositories. Towards providing a practical guide for producing a high quality description of biomedical datasets, the W3C Semantic Web for Health Care and the Life Sciences Interest Group (HCLSIG) identified Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabularies that could be used to specify common metadata elements and their value sets. The resulting guideline covers elements of description, identification, attribution, versioning, provenance, and content summarization. This guideline reuses existing vocabularies, and is intended to meet key functional requirements including indexing, discovery, exchange, query, and retrieval of datasets, thereby enabling the publication of FAIR data. The resulting metadata profile is generic and could be used by other domains with an interest in providing machine readable descriptions of versioned datasets.",2016,9/12/16 17:11,9/12/16 17:11,,e2331,,,4,,PeerJ,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 27602295 PMCID: PMC4991880,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27602295,,Data profiling; Dataset descriptions; FAIR data; Metadata; Provenance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
