The Seattle School Board, in 1961,  had issued a statement on its position  regarding a Seattle community college,  but, until late 1963, had not commenced a formal study of the problem.  Chairman Dave Wagoner of the Public Schools Committee formed a subcommittee to study this problem in  November, 1963, and at the same time  the Seattle School District commenced  an independent feasibility study preparatory to making its own recommendations. Both the League and  School District studies were concluded  in the summer of 1964 and each study  independently recommended that a  public community college be established in Seattle.  The League Subcommittee, headed  by Phillip E. Gladfelter, in addition to  inspecting the facilities of Everett  Junior College and literature in the  community college area, heard a number of well-informed speakers discuss  different aspects of a community college form of education.  The Subcommittee examined three  basic areas in reaching its conclusion.  The   first   was   the   statistical   school  the Stattle area,  inquiry was  the  The second area of  type of community  college needed in Seattle in view of  offerings of existing educational institutions. Finally, the Subcommittee investigated the financial and administrative problems posed by a Seattle  community college.  In a nutshell, the Subcommittee concluded :  1. ""A community college of substantial size is presently urgently  needed in Seattle and this need  should not be neglected. Seattle  should forthwith prepare and file  its application for a community  college."" (Subsequent to approval  of the League report the Seattle  School board took this action by  filing its application with the  State Board of Education.)  2. ""The curriculum of this community college should be comprehensive in nature, with substantial stress being placed on meeting local needs for up-to-date  vocational technical training.""  3. ""The Seattle School Board must  actively pursue acquisition of a  100-acre or greater portion of Ft.  Lawton, should Ft. Lawton be  hereafter abandoned by the  United States Army.""  4. ""The need for a Seattle Community College outweights any  local financial burden it may cre  ate, and the local financial implications of constructing such an  institution in Seattle should not  be a deterent.""  Public community colleges in Washington must be approved by the State  Board of Education after application  by the sponsoring School District. The  School District must meet certain  statutory criteria in order to qualify.  These include an adequate population  concentration within a reasonable service area; ample school enrollments in  grades 1 through 12 and 9 through 12,  and an ample number of high school  graduates to be served; evidence of  probable sustained growth in school  enrollment in the service area; evidence of a need for community college  service in view of identifiable existing  educational services offered in the area;  and proof of financial ability of the  service area to contribute to the support of a community college.  In examining the Seattle situation  the Subcommittee found that the number of students to be served in the  Seattle area far exceeded the minimum  requirements of the State Board of  Education. For example, the State  Board requires at least 450 annual  high school graduates, whereas Seattle  high school graduates in 1964 numbered 5,864. Using both State Board  of Education and Seattle School District formulae, the Subcommittee concluded that the predicted attendance  at a Seattle community college opened  within the very near future should,  (Continued on Page 7)  \",,,,,,,7/5/15,7/5/15,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p16118coll7/id/0,0,1.jp2,/p16118coll7/image/1.jp2,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=p16118coll7&CISOPTR=1&action=2&DMSCALE=10&DMWIDTH=10000&DMHEIGHT=10000&DMX=0&DMY=0,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=p16118coll7&CISOPTR=1&action=2&DMSCALE=100&DMWIDTH=10000&DMHEIGHT=10000&DMX=0&DMY=0

League members have been  invited to view the film.  The 33-minute film presents a visual  summary of the findings of a British  government committee set up to study  Page 2  Paul W. Seibert, executive  vice-president of the Central Association of Seattle, recently told  the League City Planning Committee about the plans of the Central Association for the redevelopment of the present Pike Place  Market.  The present Pike Place Market,  which was begun in 1907 and is privately owned, has seen no new development in over a half century. The  income to the city which administers  the Market has reduced from $20,000  in 1937 to $8,000 in 1963.  The area included in the proposal  includes about twelve and a half acres  bounded by James Street on the south,  Lenora on the north, First Avenue on  the east and Alaskan Way Viaduct on  the west. Structures in the area generally blighted and undobutedly would  qualify under both state and federal  laws for redevelopment by urban renewal. According to Seibert there has  been a general weakening of the neighborhood area between First and Third  and a debilitating effect on the Central  Business District properties to the east.  One of the difficulties has been in inducing the 24 owners of the 73 parcels  of the area to unite on a comprehensive  plan of rehabilitation.  The rehabilitation plan for this area  would include the following:  1. One and one-half block apartment complex for 1,000 living units.  2. A 500-room hotel and a 200-  room motel. This would be part of an  effort to attract people to living in  comfortable and suitable quarters in  the downtown district.  3. A plaza between First and Western with seven levels to accommodate  about 3,000 cars. The top would be  landscaped and provided with benches,  fountains and other recreational embellishments.  4. The present Market would be  rebuilt or a new one would be designed.  5. A turn-around facility for  Seattle Transit which might include as  many as 17 bus lines.  Estimated costs of the project include the following:  Cost of land acquisition and site  preparation, $7,500,000.  Income from sale of sites to private  investors, $5,000,000.  New development cost, $1,500,000.  If this were accomplished under  urban renewal the federal share would  be about a million dollars and the  city's share about $500,000. The city's  share can be financed at least in part  by the public improvements in the  area.  Seibert said that the present tax  yield from the properties is about  $78,000 annually and if this development is made it would increase to  $765,000 or about ten times as much.  problems posed by the rapid growth  of automobile traffic in England. The  film projects the full development of  automotive traffic in modern society,  analyzes the nature of the problems  arising from this increase and recommends possible solutions. The film describes experience in other countries,  particularly West  Germany,  Sweden,  Italy and the United States.  The film has attracted a good deal  of interest in the United States. It was  recently viewed in San Francisco by  members of the State of California  Highway Department and the San  Francisco Planning Department.

But Heaven help the taxpayers if  we had City Councils inclined to hide  skeletons under budget wood-piles because the law permits plenty of obscurity.  Annual Budget Low  On Nov. 16, the League Board of  Trustees approved a recommendation  by the City Operations Committee that  the annual budget provisions in the  National Municipal League's Model  City Charter, relating to a public hearing, be incorporated in the Washington state budget law affecting cities  over 300,000 population. In fact these  provisions would be valuable in any  size city in this state.  Here are the provisions in the Model  Charter which the committee felt  should be employed in Seattle's budget  process:  1. The annual budget for both operations and capital outlays should be  prepared by the Mayor as the head  of the spending departments.  2. The Mayor is required to submit  an explanation and interpretation of  all important changes in the budget,  when he transmits the budget to the  city council.  Must Show Work Program  3. The budget shall contain work  programs and performance statistics  for various municipal activities and  services for the coming year.  4. The Council shall publish a notice of a public hearing two weeks  prior to the day and shall make available to interested citizens copies of the  budget as tentatively adopted.  5. Following the public hearing the  council shall adopt the budget, making  whatever changes it deems necessary in  the light of the hearing.  6. This law makes no provision for  publishing a preliminary budget which  is required under the Washington law.  Change Fiscal Year  City Council Budget Officer Carl  Norman points out that to comply  with this suggested procedure, it might  be necessary to change the city's present calendar year to a June to June  fiscal year like the Seattle School  Board.  He also suggests the possibility of  reviewing and revising the state budget law during the next two years before the 1967 legislature.  LETTERS   WE  APPRECIATE  Glenn B. Eastburn, vice-president  New York Airways, former League  executive secretary, recently wrote us,  ""Your organization-building brochure  just came to my attention. I think it is  one of the best that I have ever seen  and I have seen a lot of them . . .  You and your good staff are to be congratulated and I feel sure that the  financial and volunteer response will  return many times the investment in  time and thought. ... It is a matter  of pride to have once been a part of  the Municipal League of Seattle.""  Several post-election letters were received from County Commissioner  Scott Wallace and County Engineer  Walter Winters. Both expressed thanks  to the League for its help in putting  over the $5 million County bond issue  for flood control which was voted on  at the November election and was carried by only a few votes. County Commissioner Scott Wallace said, ""King  County's vital flood control program  will be continued because your MUNICIPAL NEWS gave the voter the  information he needed to make an intelligent decision. . . . You are to be  commended for your instrumental role  in the passage of this important  measure.""  County Engineer Walter Winters  wrote in the same vein.  Airport Finds Contract  Janitorial Services  Efficient and Economical  Beginning Jan. 1, 1961, the  Seattle - Tacoma International  Airport began contracting for  janitorial services.  According to Donald J. Shea, airport manager, ""We have found this  method of janitor service to be most  satisfactory from a cost standpoint as  well as an efficiency efficiency standpoint."" In addition to substantial  monetary savings other benefits accruing from this program were:  1. Reduction of the administrative  work load connected with the 30 positions formerly authorized in this category. This applied not only to the Airport staff but to the additional work  load in the Port of Seattle payroll department.  2. Improved janitorial service.  While it was agreed that janitorial service previously performed was about  average for public buildings there was  room for improvement. Professional  supervision and direction permitted  these improvements.  3. Reduction in purchasing and related activities. The contract eliminates  the numerous separate requisitions,  purchasing orders and related matters  for window washing, laundry and  cleaning for janitors' equipment and  supplies. This item also helps to reduce the work load in the purchasing  and accounts payable departments of  the Port of Seattle.  In preparing the contract for bids  and administering the contract once it  is let, it was necessary to prepare a set  of specifications and instructions which  included some 48 pages. The document  went into considerable detail as to frequencies and types of services to be  provided. It was based largely on specifications for this type of service at airports in Portland, Detroit and Cleveland.

Lewis,  in response to a story which appeared in the MUNICIPAL  NEWS recently, wrote a thoughtful and probing letter to League  President Frederic M. Kettenring  raising questions as to whether  or not the League was in tune  with the ""urban nature of the  county."" The text of the letter  follows.  ""I was very interested to read the  December 14 issue of the Municipal  News, particularly Jim Ellis' article on  the 'Community Role of the Municipal  League in Changing Urban Environment'. I thought Jim's remarks were  much to the point, and showed us some  of the things we must do if the League  is to be, or to remain, a viable force  in this community.  ""Particularly I address this letter to  two comments on page 138 .. . citizen leagues, born in central cities,  must expand their membership and  activity to the metropolitan area . . .  now is the time for leagues to spread  the idea that good citizenship means  full share citizenship in the metropolitan area.  ""Not so many years ago two-thirds  of the people in the County lived in  Seattle, and the League was known as  the Municipal League of Seattle. Today  approximately one-half of the population in King County resides outside  Seattle. True, the League's name has  been broadened to include 'King County' but I think you will agree that,  rightly or wrongly, in the minds of the  man in the street and the news media,  we are still the Seattle Municipal  League.  ""Population predictions show that  within the next 20 years, two-thirds of  the County population will reside outside Seattle. Certainly this is the  changing urban environment to which  Jim referred. This is the area where  we must concentrate our efforts to produce meaningful and forward looking  government. I believe these changes  are going to be harder to push through  with the leadership of the League (and  we must provide that leadership) if the  suburban residents in any way feel that  the changes are Seattle sponsored.  They may, in fact, not be, but the support of a Seattle Municipal League  may be the factor that weighs the scale  in favor of suburban rejection of necessary reform.  ""Why, then, do we not put the  League in tune with the urban nature  of the entire county, and call ourselves  the Citizens League of King County,  or some similar name. The point would  be to abandon the word 'Municipal'  which subconsciously connotes big  city-type government, and to cease to  distinguish between Seattle and the rest  of the County. Any meaningful governmental reform will do this, why  don't we lead the way with our name,  now?  ""To keep in tune with this change  shouldn't we also look at the basis for  selection of the Trustees and Advisory  Council? I am aware that these people  do not represent 'areas', but don't we  kind of imply that, never-the-less, by  especially designating three members  (appointed, I believe) as representing  Bothell, Kent and Bellevue. It happens  that at the moment, of the elected officers and Trustees, 16 reside in Seattle  and 7 reside outside Seattle in King  County, not counting the 3 appointees.  However, all 23 of them have their  place of business in Seattle.  ""On the 30 member Advisory Council, only 2 live in King County outside  Seattle, and there are no especially  designated members representing  'County Areas.'  ""Thus, taking both Trustees and Advisory Council together, 43 reside in  Seattle and 9 reside in the County, with  2 from Kitsap and the 3 appointees,  but only the 3 appointees have a place  of business outside Seattle.  ""By these statistics I am not in any  way infering the present Trustees have  maintained a narrow or parochial view  of our contemporary problems, rather  I am trying to show that if the confidence and support of the 'suburbs' is  to be obtained either by the League  or for any governmental change we  may wish to push in the future, then  maybe we should endeavor to structure our Board of Trustees and Advisory Council to reflect better the  community we are endeavoring to  serve. Certainly more than 3 Trustees  should wear the official mantle of 'outside Seattle' membership; but perhaps  they should appear rather as equals  instead of the present impression of a  cursory genuflection in the direction of  the suburbs.

Many of these measures include a  re-examination of the recommendations of the Citizen Advisory Committee on Urban Area Government which  were formulated prior to the 1963  Legislature. Committees particularly  involved in this and related studies  were the Metropolitan Problems Committee, Taxation and Revenue Committee, Governmental Research Committee and City Operations Committee.  Following are some of the major  proposals:  1. Improve procedures for the consolidation of cities and towns.  2. An increase in the minimum  population requirement for incorporation of cities in urban areas from three  to five thousand.  3. Provision permitting cities to  annex territories to which it supplies  two or more direct services by uni-  laterial action of city councils.  4. Provision to permit cities to annex territory which is surrounded by  the city or by the city and a navigable  body of water by unilateral action of  the city council.  5. Provision to permit cities to annex or consolidate across county boundaries.  6. Provision for open spaces. This  was introduced in the 1963 session as  House Bill 120.  7. A constitutional amendment  granting specific home rule powers to  cities.  8. Establishment of an Interim  Committee to prepare a home rule  statutory code for cities.  9. Provision to ensure that school  district boundaries will not be affected  by changes in city boundaries.  10. Permit pre-anexation planning  by cities.  11. Require improved public hearings on city budgets in cities over  300,000 population.  12. Shift the responsibility for preparation for the preliminary budget from  the council to the mayor of the City  of Seattle.  13. Require the election of state  representatives by position.  14. Eliminate residence requirements for port district commissioners.  15. Create an automatic Legislative redistricting procedure.  16. Increase legislative representation for King County to add two Senate  and four House seats.  17. Grant advisory planning powers  to Metro.  A number of other measures are still  under consideration and will be acted  upon in the near future. In addition,  a special League committee has been  established to review bills introduced  during the session and take action on  them as necessary.  Courses to Be Offered  To County Jail Inmates  Plans are being completed by the  Seattle School District Division of  Adult and Vocational Education for  offering four classes at the King County jail for inmates serving not less than  90-day sentences who volunteer for the  classes.  Screening and interviewing of applicant is now being conducted. Course  offerings are planned to meet the need  of the more than 15 prisoners who  have applied. It is expected that  courses required for high school graduation will be offered as well as some  in basic skills (reading, writing and  mathematics) for those individuals  whose tests indicate a need for these  courses.  After the students have been given  aptitude tests, they will receive vocational guidance and information about  the current job market.  TO   NEW  MEMBERS  LILLA C. NORMAN, 5650 ll+h Ave. N.E.

The meetings are held every Tuesday morning beginning shortly after  Labor Day and running until about the  middle of June. The meetings are held  in downtown Minneapolis and run  from 7:30 until 8:30 a.m. Attendance  runs, depending on interest, from a  low of about thirty to a high of about  70.  Each week the organization mails  postcards announcing the next two  weeks' programs to about 250 members and others who have expressed an  interest in the program. In addition announcements are made in the semimonthly Citizens League News which  has a mailing of about 3,000. Special  announcements are made in certain  cases where the speaker would be of  special interest to certain segments of  the community.  The programs are carefully planned  so there is variety and varied interest  in the programs offered. Since the Citizens League is primarily concerned  with local and metropolitan area government problems most of the speakers and topics are around this area.  Prior to state and local elections, however, a number of programs are devoted to candidates and ballot propositions. Programs currently are devoted largely to the 1965 session of the  Minnesota State Legislature and problems to be conforted by the Legislature. The organization currently plans  to have the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the State House of  Representatives and other officials at  its breakfast meetings. Later programs  will be devoted to legislative programs  and proposals of local government  agencies.  Previous programs have presented  the Minneapolis Mayor, the Administrator of the General Hospital, the  Judge of the Juvenile Court, a Minneapolis Alderman, a St. Paul Commissioner, a Law Professor, Chairman of  the Minneapolis School Board, a suburban Mayor, a member of the Housing Authority, Police Chiefs, Planning  Directors and others.  Response of members of the organization and other interested citizens has  been highly favorable.  75 Per Cent of County  Road Jobs Are Done  By Private Contract  County Engineer Walter Winters appears to be a friend of private enterprise.  He told a League committee recently  that whereas in 1959 only about 31  per cent of the construction of county  bridges and roads was done by private  contractors instead of by county crews,  last year with twice the size of the  program, 73 per cent of such work  was done by private contractors after  competitive bidding.  Winters points out that this practice  of having private contractors do this  construction work frees the county of  the necessity of maintaining expanded  year-round construction crews. The  existence of such crews who have to  be kept busy, sometimes leads them  into jobs which are not too important.  Winters figures that he has saved  about $500,000 a year by having his  bridge and highway jobs done by private contractors instead of by county  crews.  League Organization . . .

""I am aware, too, that maybe our  membership is proportionately greater  amongst Seattle residents. If this is  true, then our membership drive must  be oriented to the suburbs, but to attract these citizens, they need both a  place in our councils and a program  to attract them.  ""I trust I have not labored my point,  but as a suburbanite, who has and does  work in both the suburbs and in in  Seattle, I have been concerned with  this question for some time. My review  of the League By-Laws shows that any  change necessarily must come from the  Board; the League set-up is very much  'Trustee controlled' and the avenue for  change by direct membership action  appears to be almost impossible. In  any case, there really is no reason why  a change has to come from below.  Jim's article is critical of local government officials for a reluctance to  change at the top, so I am sure we  should not wish to be guilty of the pot  calling the kettle black.  ""The area of changing suburban-  urban relationships is our present  greatest challenge. I congratulate both  Jim and the League for the part they  played to date. I hope we shall be able  to move further, faster and on a broader front in the future. I am very willing  to be a part of this movement. I shall  appreciate your comments on the  points I have raised.  Cordially yours,  Brian J.   Lewis,  P.E.""

A questionnaire prepared by the  Subcommittee and submitted to a 20%  sampling of Seattle public and parochial high school juniors and seniors, and  10% of their parents, indicated that  23% of the students who anticipated  further education wanted to attend  some nearby public community college (most of which are already over  applied), and 35.7% of these students  contemplated attending some post high  school institution other than a four-  year college or university. 57% of the  responding students thought they would  live at home while continuing their  education, and 33% had definite plans  for continuing a present part-time job.  Parents of roughly one-third of the  children responding had aspirations for  vocational, evening, or community college education for their children, and  65% indicated a willingness to pay a  small increase in rent or property taxes  to finance construction of a Seattle  community college.  The Subcommittee also submitted  questionnaires to the University of  Washington, Seattle University, Seattle  Pacific, and Central and Western  Washington State Colleges, as well as  Everett, Shoreline, Highline and Olympic Junior Colleges. All of these institutions unanimously favored the establishment of a Seattle community college, and none saw any serious problems of curricular conflict with a  Seattle Community College. All these  institutions were experiencing overcrowding, and welcomed help from the  Seattle School District. The need for  a community college in Seattle can  also be seen from the fact that in the  fall of 1963 1,958 Seattle students  were attending community colleges  elsewhere in the state.  The Subcommittee received response from industry and other civic  groups indicating favorable reactions to  a Seattle community college.  Current Washington statutes permit  a community college to offer college  transfer courses, vocational and technical education, adult education, and  general cultural courses, or to specialize in any of these areas. While the  Subcommittee encountered differing  viewpoints as to what emphasis should  presently be placed upon vocational  and technical education in a Seattle  community college, it concluded that  at the present time a comprehensive  curriculum was best suited to Seattle's  needs. The Seattle School District  could expect a substantial enrollment  in college transfer, vocational-technical,  and adult educational areas, and, since  a community college is intended to  serve as broadly as possible the needs  of the community, there would be distinct disadvantages starting with a  specialized institution where no other  provision had been made for the other  local needs. It is characteristic of a  community college that students should  have freedom to experiment in various  educational areas until they find a curriculum for which they are best suited,  and a specialized community college  would not at the present time meet  this need in Seattle.  Particular need for advanced vocational-technical education exists, both  in Seattle and in the nation's community colleges today. It appears that  training curricula for metallurgy, electronics, data processing, and the distributive services are particularly desirable in the Seattle area at this time.  The Subcommittee learned during the  course of its study that manpower  utilization surveys, conducted on a  country-wide basis at regular intervals,  would be particularly useful in developing reliable figures concerning  employment and occupational trends  necessary to the intelligent planning  of vocational-technical education. Such  surveys would be sponsored by the  Washington Bureau of Employment  Security in connection with the federal  government, and a pressing need for  such a survey exists in the Seattle area  at this time.  The Seattle School District has acquired a 24-acre site on Beacon Hill  which it could use as a construction  site for any community college now  contemplated. However, this site is  small and below the generally suggested minimum of 40 acres for a community college, and cannot possibly  satisfy Seattle's utimate needs. A  Seattle community college in the not  too distant future could approach  5,000 students, and the Subcommittee  felt that a site size of 100 acres was  none too large. Consequently, the Subcommittee urged that the. School District make every effort to acquire as  large a portion of Ft. Lawton as would  be made available to it, and in no event  less than 100 acres. Ft. Lawton is one  of the few, if not the only, adequate  sites remaining for the construction of  a community college in the Seattle  area.  The Subcommittee noted that careful construction of multiple purpose  buildings and full utilization of building space, as well as wide use of community experts as part-time faculty,  would go far toward reducing the taxpayers' dollar cost of education in a  Seattle community college.  The Subcommittee found no serious  financial problem arising by reason of  a Seattle community college. Under  present Washington law community  colleges are constructed and operated  by a local school district, and the  school board administers the community college as well as the kindergarten through 12 grade program.  Under existing patterns of financial  assistance, the Seattle School District  would have to supply the building site  out of its local funds, and the Seattle  School District has already spent approximately $600,000 to acquire the  Beacon Hill site. Additional acreage  in the Seattle area (other than Ft. Law-  ton which would probably be free)  could run from $25,000 to $100,000  per acre, depending upon location,  size, and improvements to the lot. For  practical purposes, the Seattle School  (Continued on Page 8)  Monday, January 11, 1965  Page 7",,,,,,,7/5/15,7/5/15,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p16118coll7/id/6,6,7.jp2,/p16118coll7/image/7.jp2,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=p16118coll7&CISOPTR=7&action=2&DMSCALE=10&DMWIDTH=10000&DMHEIGHT=10000&DMX=0&DMY=0,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=p16118coll7&CISOPTR=7&action=2&DMSCALE=100&DMWIDTH=10000&DMHEIGHT=10000&DMX=0&DMY=0

(Continued from Page 7)  District presently has a beginning site  for a community college.  Under current state law a school district receives on the average slightly  more than 50% of the total cost of  community college construction from  the state. However, to qualify for  state-matching funds for construction,  a school district must be bonded up to  an amount equivalent to 10% of the  taxable valuation of property within  the district. This is a condition of  eligibility for state-matching funds,  which many school districts throughout the state have satisfied. Unless  the law is changed, Seattle will have  to bear the entire cost of constructing  a community college itself, unless the  Seattle voters approve a local bond  issue raising Seattle to the 10% figure.  Seattle's current bonded indebtedness  is approximately $53,500,000, which  is well below the 10% figure for the  Seattle School District ($89,400,000).  Seattle is further handicapped by an  existing state law which does not make  matching funds available for remodeling buildings, and this restriction deserves legislative change.  On the basis of a recent state study  of actual cost figures for the three most  recently completed Washington community colleges, it can be expected  that the total capital expenditure for  construction and equipment will average about $3,000 per student in a community college having a rated capacity  of less than 1,000 students. If a community college has a capacity of over  1,000 students, the capital cost for  each student over 1,000 students would  be only $2,000 per student, suggesting  that would be an economy in bigness  in a Seattle community college. Using  these figures, the cost of construction  and equipping a Seattle community  college enrolling 3,500 full-time students would approximate $6,000,000,  Seattle's half of which could be financed by a local bond issue requiring not  more than  an  additional  Vi   mill to  service. The Subcommittee felt that  this debt would not jeopardize any obligations of the Seattle School District  to improve and remodel its kindergarten through 12th grade facilities  where necessary.  Operating funds for community colleges come primarily from the state,  and are based principally upon weighted credit hours of enrollment. Student  fees, flat grants, and federal assistance  make up most of the balance of the  annual operating cost of a community  college. The operating cost of a community college in Washington in  1962-3 ($685 annual average cost per  pupil) was approximately $150 more  than the annual operating cost per  pupil for Seattle high school students.  Whether or not Seattle was forced  to bear the major portion of the construction cost of the community college itself, it appears clear that there  is a distinct and pressing need for a  community college in Seattle at this  time to serve the needs of Seattle  youth.

Posed Three Threats  This was the question put to 21  members of the League's Utiities and  Services Committee on Jan. 15, by City  Water Superintendent Ray Heath and  Assistant Supt. Jerry Allen. They  listed the following threatening possibilities for the impairing of our water  supply bearing in mind that the public  is now excluded from our two watersheds :  1. The U. S. Forest Service is  making plans to do some logging in its  tract in the Tolt Watershed with a new  access road which will admit visitors  and enable them to make use of the  recreational facilities of the area. Heath  fears a similar opening of the federal  tract in the Cedar River Watershed.  2. A bill is likely to be introduced  in this legislative session opening public watersheds of more than 200 acres  for   recreational   purposes.    Such   a  measure has been presented in recent  legislative sessions but has been defeated because of the opposition of  public health and water groups.  3.

This highway is  sought by the County Commissioners  to provide a winter access road for the  125 inhabitants of the mountain town  of Lester and Green River Valley  farmers.  Will Hear Both Sides  Following its usual custom, the  League group will hear the other side  of the story at a future meeting.  Water Superintendent Heath denied  that this is a ""Wolf, Wolf"", alarmist  warning. He contended that the invasion of some thousands of hunters,  fishermen, campers and others into the  watersheds poses a potential risk to  city water from water-borne diseases  and other contaminants, as well as a  big increase in the fire hazard. Heath  said it would be impossible to police  the many acres of watershed to prevent  these dangers. The result is likely to  be orders from the Washington State  Health Department to the City of  Seattle to treat its water and possibly  from the United States Public Health  Service if our water is used in interstate commerce.  In addition, Heath said that the City  Water Department on its own violition  would not wish to expose our water-  users to these risks so the city might  itself embark on a water purification  program. At present the only treatment given Seattle water is a moderate  inexpensive chlorination. However,  complete treatment such as is provided  in other cities which drink water from  rivers and lakes containing the effluent from other cities, includes coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and more  chlorination. This is what contributes  to the much higher water rates in other  cities than in Seattle.  High Cost of Water Treatment  Full treatment of city water costs  about $50,000 to $100,000 per million gallons, Heath said. On this basis,  treatment facilities of water from the  Tolt watershed would cost about $4.5  million and about $10.5 for the Cedar  Watershed. This would require the issuance of revenue bonds with resulting  interest and an inevitable increase in  water rates.  Heath said he is puzzled by the paradox of one federal department, the  Forestry Service, being willing to admit visitors to a public watershed, followed by the U. S. Public Health Service ordering the city to take steps to  protect itself from the health and sanitation hazards from these visitors.  ""With the 15,000 square miles of  wilderness controlled by the Forest  Service in this state, in which sportsmen can have their fun, why is it necessary to admit them to the public watersheds,"" Heath inquired.  Early Exclusion Policy  Water Superintendent Heath said in  part:  In 1895, when the City of Seattle  started to acquire the Cedar River  Watershed, it expressed a policy that  this reservation should be closed to  recreation as a protection to the city  water. Now, the city owns about 75%  of the 143 square miles in this watershed. The other owners including the  Weyerhaeuser Company and the  United States Forest Service, have  agreed to sell, give or exchange their  land to the city as it is logged off. The  latter expects under this arrangement  to own it all in about 43 years.  The City of Seattle now has the two  watersheds, the Tolt River which is  northeast of the city and the Cedar  River watershed which is southeast of  town. Both watersheds include land  owned by the United States Forest  Service. Both are now entirely closed  to the public through agreements by  the Forest Service and private owners  to abide by the closure rules of the City  Water Department.  Tolt Area May Be Opened  The City Water Department has  learned that the U. S. Forest Service is  planning to do some logging in its area  in the Tolt River Watershed and will  construct a public road as part of this  operation. Under a recent ""multiple  use"" federal law it plans to open this  area for recreational purposes. This,  Heath claims, would threaten the  purity of a portion of the Seattle water  supply which drains from this area.  He is apprehensive that with this  opening of a part of the Tolt Watershed, the Forest Service might open its  area in the Cedar River Watershed  despite the 1962 agreement that its  area would conform to the closing rules  Page 10  MUNICIPAL NEWS",,,,,,,7/5/15,7/5/15,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p16118coll7/id/10,10,11.jp2,/p16118coll7/image/11.jp2,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=p16118coll7&CISOPTR=11&action=2&DMSCALE=10&DMWIDTH=10000&DMHEIGHT=10000&DMX=0&DMY=0,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=p16118coll7&CISOPTR=11&action=2&DMSCALE=100&DMWIDTH=10000&DMHEIGHT=10000&DMX=0&DMY=0

However, Heath said, the Secretary of Agriculture recently cancelled an agreement of 1914 with the City of Tacoma  and plans to open its area in this  watershed for recreational purposes.  Another threat comes from the State  Legislature. In each recent session the  sportsmen have introduced a bill  throwing open to recreation public  watersheds having more than 200  acres.  The Road to Lester  A third threat comes from action  by the King County Commissioners,  said Heath. In the little mountain community of Lester and in the adjoining  Green River there are about 125  people. In the summer they can have  access to the outside world through  the Stampede Pass Highway which is  closed in the winter. However, during  the winter the County Commissioners  post a man at the gate at the end of  a two-mile stretch of road through the  Seattle Watershed through which he  admits people from Lester who wish to  come to town. The Seattle Watershead  road is connected with 25 miles in the  Tacoma Watershed in King County.  However, due to vigorous pressure  from the mountain people, the King  County Commissioners have resorted  to court action to compel Seattle and  Tacoma Water Departments to relinquish 27 miles in their watersheds as a  county road which would give the  Lester people a year round access.  Heath is quite certain that this public  road will invite an unlimited number  of drivers whose actions in the watershed cannot be controlled.  Different Groups Object  On Jan. 14, there was a meeting of  38 people in Tacoma who were interested in this problem. Eight cities were  represented whose water supplies are  used by two million people. There were  also eight representatives from the  United States Public Heilth Service;  eight from the Washington State Health  Department    and    five    representing  County and City Health Departments  and the balance were waterworks officials. It was the consensus of this  group that any legislation or any directives, state or notional, which would  open the watersheds in this state,  should be opposed. The Association of  Washington Cities has taken similar action to oppose any opening of the  watershed. The King County Medical  Society has pledged its support to the  City Water Department.  Jerry Allen, assistant superintendent  of the Seattle Water Department ( who  is President of the American Waterworks Association, said that this organization in the past ten years has  urged caution in the extension of  recreation in public watersheds.  It was decided that Chairman Wellington Rupp of the Utilities Committee, would appoint a subcommittee  which would inquire into this matter  and consider all sides.  New Fountains Pop Up;  Sponsors Wanted For  Several New Gushers  Much to our pleasure, we have  heard of additional fountains to  those which we enumerated in the  NEWS of Decmber 24. The list  contained in that issue was furnished by Water Superintendent  Ray Heath.  Paul W. Seibert, executive vice-  president of the Central Association,  reports that a large new fountain has  been commissioned by Joshua Green,  Sr., as an embellishment to the new  Colman Ferry Terminal. This is a feature of the Central Association's  ""sponsored art"" project for which Tom  Gildersleeve is chairman.  Who'll Be a Fountain Sponsor  Seibert says the Association is seeking a sponsor for a small fountain in  the triangular pork to be installed this  spring at Stuart and Westlake to replace the old comfort station. Other  fountain locations are available including sites in the two ""sitting out parks""  to be built on excess Freeway property  Ù__one across from the Women's University Club and the other on the  block northeast of the Municipal  Building.  The well-known consulting engineer,  Lincoln Bouillon, reported to us that  we had neglected to list one of Seattle's  best known fountains, Drumheller  Fountain on the University of Washington campus.  Operating Costs Not Low  Bouillon states that ""your article  fails to tell the full story of fountains,  as the first cost is usually insignificant  as compared with the cost of operating  one.""  Taking the International Fountain in  the Civic Center as an example, Mr.  Bouillon says, ""I wonder how many  people know that it requires 350  horsepower to pump the water used by  the fountain. The electric power alone  for the International Fountain will cost  in the neighborhood of $3 an hour or  about $18,000 a year. Considering  everything, the total cost of operating  this fountain will be in the neighborhood of $25,000 a year, not including  depreciation and interest on the in-  ventment.  He says that the Municipal League  may wish to see Seattle become a ""city  of fountains"" but should take a long  look at the cost of operation before  proposing it.  How many of our members and  other citizens are worried at the high  cost of fountains?

During the past half century of its  existence, the Municipal League has  built ivy-covered traditions with which  our present members should be acquainted and which should give them  inspiration for future endeavors.  One sees in the pages of the MUNICIPAL NEWS, from Vol. 1, No. 1,  June 24, 1911, to the year 1965, the  unrolling panorama of the civic history  of this cityÙ__plans achieved and those  which faded; civic victories and defeats;  civic skeletons and glowing accomplishments, and the ebb and flow of  citizen interest and participation in  their public affairs. Also, one sees in  these pages a procession of thousands  of persons who cared about making  this a great city and sought to achieve  this goal through membership in the  Seattle Municipal League. Many are  the fathers and grandfathers of men  who are now active in this organization.  The First Municipal League in 1 894  We go back farther than the formation of the present League in 1910, to  the launching of the first Municipal  League in Seattle in 1894. It was organized in the same year that Theodore Roosevelt and other young reformers founded the National Municipal League in Philadelphia. The Seattle group was inspired by the same  recoil from the sordid level of municipal government of that period and was  inspired with a zeal to cleanse it.  The facts about this early organization are found in an old, well-preserved  ledger book which has been lying on  the shelves of the League office.  The first minutes describe the meeting at the Chamber of Commerce on  March 17, 1894. Among those present  whose names were attached to the  Constitution, were such well-known  pioneer citizens as A. A. Denny, Morgan J. Carkeek, A. P. Burwell, John  McGilvra, Dexter Horton, E. C. Kil-  bourne and others. Their goals include  reforms which have since been  achieved including one instead of two  city legislative chambers and non-partisan city elections.  Launched  1 896 Charter  The greatest accomplishment of this  first League was a recommendation to  the Mayor and City Council that they  call an election of 15 freeholders to  revise the city charter. From this came  the improved Seattle charter of 1896.  The last minutes of this organization  reported a meeting on January 7, 1895.  Sixteen years later came the formation of the present Seattle Municipal  League. Like its predecessor it was  launched in demoralizing civic surroundings. The city hall and court  house were shot through with politics  in their worst aspects. Many employees  were appointed regardless of qualifications but because of their political help  at the last election. Minor graft among  public officials was tolerated and major  graft probably transpired when it could  be gotten away with. The red light  district was a continuous and demoralizing threat to good government  with payments to the police and other  officials for protection.  Started From Debating Club  The present League originated as an  idea of a group of young men who  met at the YMCA as a debating club.  About seven of them met in the law  office of Frank Bayley and decided to  form the Seattle Municipal League.  The first meeting with about 120  present, was held at the Chamber of  Commerce on May 21, 1910. The  first president was Hugh Caldwell,  later Corporation Counsel and Mayor.  During this decade the Municipal  League, with the fervor of St. George,  charged at myriads of municipal dragons. Small committees were assigned  to work on every current civic problem. They brought their conclusions  to Saturday noon meetings of members  where the chairman read the committee reports and resolutions and more  times than not they were approved by  members present without too much  concern for evidence. A year later the  League decided to start a publication  to disseminate its views and educate  citizens. The first issue of the MUNICIPAL NEWS came out on June  24, 1911.  In the second decade of the twentieth century, there were few service  clubs and noon committee meetings.  So the Saturday noon Municipal League  meetings of members became an outstanding institution in the city. Interspersed with discussions of committee  reports were addresses given by some  of the foremost personages in the  country. These included Lorado Taft,  celebrated sculptor; Booker T. Washington, illustrous negro educator;  David Starr Jordan, president of Stanford University; Congressman Henry  George, Jr., of single tax fame; Lincoln  Steffens, the author of the famous  book, The Shame of the Cities, and  others.  First Candidates' Report  The first report on candidates appeared in the NEWS of Sept. 19, 1911,  which reported on candidates for  county offices. In the Feb. 10, 1912  issue, appeared the first report on  candidates for city offices.

Here  are some of the comments about different candidates.  ""Doorkeeper of Seattle Electric  Company; discharged. At that time  was intemeprate.""  ""This candidate has voted consistently with vicious elements.""  ""Very free in voting city money.""  ""As a merchant went through voluntary bankruptcy in 1899 and 1908.""  In these early elections the League  had watchers at the polling places, particularly in the downtown precincts.  The watchers at one polling place secured the arrest of several election  clerks who were sentenced to jail for  election frauds. One election clerk was  a one-legged man who sold pencils for  a living. He had come from Montana  only the year before. He protested his  innocence and said, ""I would much  rather be arrested for bank robbery  than for doing anything crooked at an  election which would ruin my reputation.""  Pushed Bogue Plan  One of the League's prime projects  in its early days was the promotion of  the Bogue Plan for downtown and a  civic center development. The Bogue  Civic Center was located on the Re-  grade and consisted of a pie-shaped  affair with the various segments representing different buildings in the complex.  During this period membership grew  from the initial 120 in 1910 to 1,283  in 1914. This dipped to 619 in 1919  which doubtless resulted from the distraction of the First World War. The  NEWS reported that members consisted chiefly of lawyers, teachers, doctors, real estate men, engineers, insurance agents, contractors and accountants, which is similar to the present  makeup. In those days there was vigorous discussion in the League board  as to whether or not to admit women  as members.  Many Projects Completed  Twenty-five different League committees were active in this decade.  They were small consisting of only half  a dozen to a dozen members. In one  year the NEWS reported they considered 60 projects of which 27 were  ""completed"". Here were some of the  noteworthy investigations during this  period.  The first perennial recommendation  for the consolidation of the City of  Seattle and King County was made.  In the 1912 city election, out of 37  ballot propositions before the voters,  27 recommended by the League were  approved, showing its growing potency.  The League recommended civil service  examinations for election clerks to cut  down the common frauds. A League-  supported City Manager Charter was  overwhelmingly beaten in 1914 by a  vote of 12,997 to 468. This was the  first of a number of similar attempts to  adopt this form of municipal government.  Showing that the garbage problem  has popped up throughout the City's  entire history, in this decade the  League aided in shifting residential  garbage collection by a private contractor to whom the householder paid  a fee, to collection by the city with  the expense paid by the city general  fund.  Many Reforms Recommended  The League recommended the use of  school buildings as community centers  which has come about in the field  houses, built with city and school  funds, which are attached to some of  the junior high schools. A League  committee clamored for cleaner moving pictures and another recommeded  the installation of more curb comfort  stations. The October 13, 1914 issue  of the MUNICIPAL NEWS announced  a program including city charter revision; county-city consolidation; nonpartisan county elections and better  milk inspections.  In 1915 the League joined in the  community  effort  to  beautify  down  town with a statement in the NEWS,  ""Let's make a flower garden of the  Seattle business district."" The NEWS  hailed the adoption of a tuberculin test  ordinance, as the ""foundation for pure  milk."" At this time the League weekly meetings were held in the Good  Eats Cafeteria.  During the closing years of this  decade, concern with local civic problems was diverted to war efforts.  TO   NEW (^  MEMBERS  H.   B.   COBURN,   1630     -43rd   Ave.   E.

This is another example of how  League committees are training  grounds for the elevation of their  outstanding committee members to appointive elective public offices.  Important Committee Reports  Dave is in his second year as chairman of the League's Public Schools  Committee. During his tour of duty,  this committee has published its excellent report and recommendation for  a Community College for Seattle as  well as another report which came to  the conclusion that 1956-63 budget increases in the Seattle School System  have not been excessive.  Dave is an attorney with the firm  of Holman, Marion, Black, Perkins  and Cole.  He attended public schools in Spring  City, Pa., and is a cum laude graduate of Lawrenceville Academy and  Yale University. His law degree is  from the University of Pennsylvania.  He came to Seattle in 1957 after serving as a law clerk to the late Justice  Harold H. Burton of the United States  Supreme Court.  Besides his work as chairman of the  Municipal League School Committee,  he is also a member of the Seattle  School District Citizens Committees on  Equal Educational Opportunity and a  former member of an Advisory Committee on Adult Education. He recently was a member of an Advisory Committee on Community Colleges of the  Legislature's Interim Committee on  Education.  Many Graduates to Public Office  Wagoner's elevation from a League  Committee to the School Board offers  an opportunity to point out how many  citizens who have performed capably  and conspicuously on League committees or on its Board of Trustees, have  been recruited for important public  jobs. Of course their own reputation  may be a reason.  A few past and present members of  the Port Commission earned their  spurs through activity on the League's  potent Port Committee. In fact, Howard Burke, retired general manager of  the Port of Seattle, served as a chairman of the League's Port Committee  before going to the Port Commission.  Other League members have served  on the City Civil Service Commission  and the Transit Commission.  Numerous League members have  served on different citizens' advisory  committees appointed by the Mayor.  Legislators Get Briefing  During the past year about a dozen  members of the State Legislature from  both parties have been active on a  group of League committees studying  metropolitan problems which will appear in the form of bills in the current  Legislature. This preliminary briefing  should be of value to these legislators.  WHY  THEY  VOTE  IN   AUSTRALIA  Voting is compulsory in Australia.

City projects whose slow consummation makes us a bit impatient: No Council action in response to Mayor Braman's  request that it invite private asphalt  suppliers to bid on city business to see  whether their cost would be lower than  at the city plant. No Council action in  trying to induce the State Department  of Labor and Industries to readjust their  rates so that this City doesn't have to  pay an annual premium of $230,000 on  annual injury claims of city employees of  only $90,000.

BONDS   FOR  BUSES  Several years ago Tacoma voters  approved a bond issue of $361,000  for the purchase of new city buses to  expand the fleet of the transit system  in that city.  However, the Seattle Transit Commission cannot submit a similar general obligation bond issue because its  bus acquisition would be to replace  old vehicles and such replacement cannot be financed by bond issue under  the state law.

Paul Friedlander Asks League Aid  To Induce City to Cut Rents and Taxes  For Opera, Symphony and Repertory Playhouse  Does the City spend enough  on our cultural facilities and  organizations? What cultural  agencies should receive special  benefits from the City? If we  give special dispensation to cultural activities should we also  give the same to sporting activities which can claim a certain  social value? How important is  it that the City's theatrical and  other buildings in the Mercer  Street complex should at least  break even, if possible?  These and other questions were  raised at the conclusion of a discussion  by Paul Friedlander, president of  Poncho, before 30 members of the  League's City Planning and City Operations Committees on Jan. 29.  Mr. Friedlander was accompanied  by Mrs. William K. Blethen, Pat Bail-  largeon, Howard S. Wright, Jr., Mrs.  David E. Skinner and Peggy Locke  Newman, executive secretary of  Poncho.  Plea for Tax Remissions  More particularly, Mr. Friedlander  recommended on behalf of his organization that the City lower or remit the  $70,000 a year rental paid by the Seattle Symphony, Opera, and Repertory Theater as well as the city admissions and business and occupation  WE WANT LETTERS  Even if some members cannot  be active on committees, we will  welcome letters from them expressing their views about current  League projects.  This issue of the NEWS contains  a number of projects which have  many provocative aspects about  which members may wish to comment.  Don't hesitate to differ with Committee findings although it must be  remembered that no committee  makes a recommendation unless it  has pretty well canvassed the subject and has heard both sides of a  controversy.  Your letters will be sent to the  Committee chairman and brought  before the committee in the same  way that a comment of a committee  member is presented.  Would Permit More Attractions  Mr. Friedlander said the savings  from these remissions of taxes and  charges could provide more and better  performances for the benefit of citizens. He believed these would attract  more outsiders to the city which would  bring more income to the hotels, restaurants and stores.  Mr. Friedlander and his associates  who are dedicated to this high goal  of promoting the arts, made a number  of bold suggestions to help finance  cultural activities. Among these were  a small tax on hotel rooms. Such  taxes are in effect in Los Angeles and  in San Francisco, he said. In the  latter city a portion of the proceeds  goes to help support the famous San  Francisco Opera. A suggestion was  also made that every person gainfully  employed should contribute an hour's  wage or salary a year for the support  of various cultural organizations. They  said the City of Los Angeles makes no  rental charge for their Symphony Orchestra in the new Music Center.  To Start United Arts Fund  Mr. Friedlander explained that  Poncho was trying to promote the organization of a United Arts Fund  which would raise from $750,000 to  $1,000,000 a year to help support the  local symphony, opera, repertory  theater and other like projects.

Dr. Schmitz apparently decided to contribute a substantial portion of his  time in retirement to the Municipal League to help accomplish its goal of improving local government. So during the past two years, he was a faithful member of the League's Metropolitan Problems and Candidates Investigating Committees. His service, particularly on the Candidates Committee in rating candidates for public office, was of a high order because of his long experience in  appraising the potentialities of persons he employed.  A retired citizen with a large experience in business and public life, can  bring to the League matured judgment and a background of experience which  is beneficial and essential to wise decisions which the League is called upon  to make.  We hope that other such citizens with Dr. Schmitz's dedication, will come  forward and fill his shoes.  so we are not coming to the City with  hat in hand. We ask that the Municipal League make a study and survey  to determine the feasibility of removing or lowering the rent of the Mercer  Street complex of buildings and remitting the city business and occupation and admission taxes. We realize  that this involves a serious question of  where to draw the line and what other  similar agencies might ask for equal  favors. We believe this is a community-wide responsibility.""  President Kettenring pointed out  that this switching from voluntary support for these cultural organizations  to taxes might arouse opposition from  individuals who are not particularly  fond of any form of art.  Mr. Wright suggested that better  performances would generate more income from other sources which would  offset the loss to the City.  Reduction in Ticket Costs?  Mrs. Blethen pointed out that these  supplementary aids to cultural organizations might result in a reduction in  costs of tickets.  Howard Embree, assistant City  Council budget director, presented a  tabulation of the different contributions by the City to cultural organizations. He pointed out that the City  now is recognizing the merits of  eleemosynary organizations  by lower  rates to non-profit organizations.  One of the Poncho speakers said  that at present more citizens nationwide visit art museums yearly than attend sporting events.  LEAGUE RECOMMENDS  LEGISLATIVE STUDY  OF TAX EXEMPTIONS  A recommendation that the Legislature establish an Interim Committee  to study the matter of tax exemptions  was made by the Board of Trustees at  its meeting on January 18.  It approved a recommendation of  the Metropolitan Problems Finance  Committee which studied this matter  of property tax exemptions for many  meetings. The committee heard the  views of County Assessor Tony Steen  and others.  However, the committee came to  the conclusion that there is too little  statistical data available about the different kinds of exemptions upon which  any sound legislation can be formulated at the present time. So the committee decided to recommend to the  Board of Trustees that the current  Legislature establish an Interim Legislative Committee to go into the matter, collect the necessary data and  recommend legislation for the 1967  session.

Preoccupation with the rigors of redistrict-  ing compounded by the court ban on other legislative activities has very nearly stalemated the  process.  Since early in the session, most legislators have agreed  that the ultimate compromise must come as a result of a  pre-conference committee. Some of the delays are caused  by conflicts in who shall serve on the committee, whether  or not it should be given a completely free rein. Until  these questions are resolved it will be just more of the  same.  Fewer Bills Introduced  One of the side effects of the redistricting problem is  the sharply reduced number of bills being introduced. The  statistics may be misleading since many of the bills that  are being introduced approach omnibus form. The reasons  of course are fear of log-jamming in the Rules Committee  because of the late start on general legislation.  One of the most bitter fought of the League-supported  bills in the 39th session is House Bill 9 which provides  an executive budget for the City of Seattle. Seattle Council  man Floyd Miller, chairman of the Finance Committee  and the City's principal lobbyist in Olympia, is adamant  and unyielding in his opposition to giving the mayor any  voice in the city's budget process.  Testifying before the Cities and Towns Subcommittee  at a public hearing on Friday, Jan. 29, Miller told the committee that Mayor Braman had informed him that he had  no interest in the city's budgetÙ__a sharp compromise from  the background and activities of the current mayor.  Leave It To Interim Group  Miller's principal points in objecting to the bill were  (1) that a Legislative Interim Committee controlled by the  Association of Washington Cities should make a study to  determine whether or not the city should have an administrative budget, the Booz, Allen & Hamilton Survey notwithstanding and (2) that the budget officer provided by  the mayor under the terms of the bill was not subject to  confirmation by the City Council. Without such confirmation, Miller said the city's budget officer would be ""just  another political hack.""  Some 20 other League-supported bills have been introduced and are waiting committee action. Public hearings have been held or are scheduled for many of these  but until the redistricting problem is solved progress will  be slow.

The 1964 deficit of $557,622 is  more than twice that of the previous  year.  While the operating revenue from  fares dropped $361,000 below 1963  the expenditures were only cut $87,-  000 which helped increase the deficit.  Two hundred forty-two thousand  less miles were traveled by Transit  trolleys and coaches in 1964 but the  revenue passengers fell 2,262,000 in  the year.  These figures show how rapidly the  transit system is headed for a subsidy  if we intend to maintain a serviceable  mass transportation system. But the  question is, what shall it be.  With the deficit now exceeding  $401,000 depreciation, it should be  only a short time when the $2,632,000  Renewal and Betterment fund will  have to be depleted to meet expenditures. When that is gone, then will  come the big cut in a few years unless  a subsidy is forthcoming.

An earlier unsuccessful effort was  revived in 1922 with a petition by the  League to the City Council to put a  City Manager Charter up to a vote of  the people. In 1925 a charter which  provided for a ""City Business Manager"" was defeated by a close vote of  27,785 to 27,308. Encouraged by this  close decision, the League succeeded  in March, 1926, in having a comprehensive City Manager Charter placed  on the ballot. Out of 90,000 votes  cast, the proposition lost by only 111  which was the closest vote on this proposal in the history of the League. As  a feeble aftermath, another watered-  down manager proposal was put before the voters that fall but the League  did not support it and it failed.  Dues Were Increased  In 1920, the individual membership  dues were increased from $2 to $3  a year. The League maintained an  office in several different buildings and  had a number of successive part-time  secretaries who were paid a nominal  amount and sometimes not even this.  In 1921 a committee was appointed  to investigate charges of mismanagement of the Public Library.  In 1922 the League won the Seattle  Times civic trophy for its plan to unify  decisions on civic projects. This trophy  still reposes in the League office as a  protective container for a large plant.  The League's winning suggestion was  that a city-wide conference be established with representatives from every  civic organization to study and pos  sibly make a unified report on major  civic problems.  Recommends Pay-As-You-Go  An interesting recommendation was  made by the Educational Committee  in 1923 that the Seattle School District  switch from paying for new schools  from bond issues, to a pay-as-you-go  plan. This has never come about because of the one year limitation of  voted levies which makes this plan  impossible in this state. By contrast,  the City of Portland for the past 40  years has built their schools on a pay-  as-you-go basis by voted levies for a  term of years.  In 1924 the League recommended  defeat of a $750,000 bond issue for  a civic auditorium which carried and  led to the construction of our present  remodelled structure on the Civic  Center.  A big step in the history of the City  came in 1924 with the creation of a  City Planning Commission. This resulted from years of urging by the  Municipal League. This agency with  its broader purview succeeded the City  Zoning Commission which had completed drafting the city zoning law.  Floating Bridge Suggested  In August 1926, the MUNICIPAL  NEWS carried a story that a group of  local citizens requested the City Council for a 50 year franchise to erect a  pontoon bridge across Lake Washington extending from Madison Park to  Evergreen Point. This private venture  never bore fruit but contained a germ  of a suggestion which later matured  into the two state-built floating bridges  across the lake.  Recognizing the growing pollution  of Lake Washington and Puget Sound,  in 1927 the League recommended formation of an official Sewage Commission to inquire into this problem. A  $2 million sewer bond issue was approved.  Transit In Trouble  In 1927 the Seattle Municipal Street  Railway was in serious fiscal trouble.  It had been accumulating a deficit and  the Seattle Clearing House had been  cashing employees' checks. But this  banking agency refused to continue  this service which forced Transit employees to go to loan sharks and other  money lenders. Forty employees were  dropped in an economy program. The  League opposed a City Council proposal to put a property tax levy on  the ballot to finance a Transit deficit.  This was the first suggestion of a transit subsidy.  In 1928 E. S. Goodwin, president  of the City Planning Commission, appealed to the League to support a plan  to formulate a comprehensive city  plan. However, this did not come  about until 1960.  The closing years of this decade saw  a slump in League activities but its  innate vitality and dedication of its  leaders kept the organization alive.  CAMPAIGN COSTS TREBLE  Campaign costs to elect members  of the Legislature have about trebled  since 1960, says Robert Paulson,  member of the League's Election Reform Committee and a candidate for  the Legislature in 1964 from the 44th  District.  Paulsen said that several years ago  the Republican State Committee asked  him to calculate the average state-wide  cost for electing a candidate for the  Legislature.   He reported as follows:  1960 campaignÙ__$1000 to $2000  1962 campaignÙ__$3000 to $4000  1964 campaignÙ__$5000 to $6000.

Who doesn't hope so?  The City Council and the Mayor  are anxious to settle this matter and  cease from being confronted with the  word ""GARBAGE"" in headlines  every day.  May Be Final Phase  Here is the latest and possibly the  last development. The City Council  on January 11, instructed the Engineering Department to formulate a  contract with the Puget Service Company (Sapro, Inc. as subcontractor)  to barge or transport garbage by truck,  and to divert a smaller portion to be  turned into compost. About the last  point of argument was that a 20 year  contract is too long. However, the  Council recognized that in justice to  investors, they should be allowed a  reasonable time to amortize the cost  of the structure containing composting  machinery. Therefore, an agreement  is now being sought to provide for renegotiation at each five or ten year  period.  To avoid the criticism of its former  procedure, the City Council is holding  open hearings on its conferences with  Puget Service. When the contract has  been finished, it will make it public so  that interested organizations and individuals can study it. Then it will hold  another public hearing at which any  person may express his views or that  of his organization.  League Speaks  On Jan. 28, the League's Utilities  and Service Committee and Board of  Trustees, in a joint meeting, adopted  the following form resolutions with a  majority though not unanimous agreement. These did not contain a recommendation for the type of garbage program because the committee felt it  could only do this after it had seen the  final contract.  1. The Municipal League has recommended and continues to recommend a joint disposal of garbage by  the City of Seattle and King County  and regrets its recommendation has  not been followed.  2. The Municipal League commends Mayor Braman for appointing  the Citizens Committee for the study  of the garbage disposal problem and  commends Mayor Braman and the  City Council for accepting and following that committee's recommendation  numbers 1, 2 and 4 through 9.  3. The Municipal League is not  aware of any evidence of bad faith or  unethical conduct by Mayor Braman  or the City Council in handling this  public transaction.  4. The Municipal League approves  the procedure of openly negotiating  garbage disposal contract terms more  favorable than those produced by the  call for bid.  Here are some background facts  which the League's garbage subcommittee, Elwood Denney, chairman, has  considered.  Garage Fund In Trouble  Without the proposed increased garbage disposal cost, the City's garbage  fund, which is financed by the $1.25 a  month per household service fee, is in  trouble. The City Comptroller's report  for 1962 discloses that the garbage  fund finished that year with a balance  of $81,118 but finished the next year  with a deficit of $173,929. This compelled a transfer of $300,000 from the  city general fund in July 1964. The  1964   year-end   figures   are   not   yet  available    but     another    deficit    is  probable.  This discloses the unpleasant fact  that the residence service charge and  dump fees are insufficient to pay the  present garbage utility costs.  It was noticeable that while the  gross revenues to this utility dropped  about $64,000 from 1963 under 1962,  the expenditures increased $191,000.  Fees Are Insufficient  The collections from the householders' fees and from the garbage  dump ticket sales bring in about  $2,800,000 while the yearly expenses  amount to about $3 million a year  with an obvious substantial difference.  Therefore as inevitable as rainy  weather hereabouts, the fees paid by  householders of $1.25 per month and  by commercial concerns, are bound to  be increased because of the change  of method of hauling garbage only a  few miles to disposal points inside the  city, to 26 miles to a distant landfill  site or a site up the Sound.  Calculating estimates from the 1963  Comptroller's report and from the  1964-65 budgets, it appears that the  budgeted costs of garbage collection  for this year of $3,032,000 will be  increased to about $4,400,000 in  1966. The present garbage disposal  which involves covering refuse at city  dumps will be increased to about  $1,800,000 under the new program of  composting and barging or transporting by truck.  Costs to Increase 45%  So, as nearly as can be estimated  from the available data, the new garbage disposal contract will increase the  City's garbage collection and disposal  cost about 45%.

WHO GOT IT?""  Frank Pritchard, member of  the State Advisory Committee on  Campaign Contributions said the  theme of that group in formulating a recommendation for a  bill for the current Legislature,  was, ""Who Gave It and Who  Got It?""  Pritchard explained the work of this  committee at a meeting of the  League's Governmental Research  Committee on January 26. Norman  Ackley presided as chairman in the  absence of Chairman Harry Prior.  This League committee endorsed  the principles in Senate Bill 12 and  House Bill 12 which embody the  recommendations of the Citizens Committee as well as the provisions in the  model law of the National Municipal  League. The action was ratified by  the League's Legislative Committee.  May Be Torpedoed  Both former Governor Rosellini and  present Governor Dan Evans, have  endorsed the principles in these bills  which do not vary greatly. It has also  received the blessing of many newspapers and individuals.  However, there is likely to be behind-the-scenes opposition to these  measures which require reporting of  all contributions and expenditures both  before and after elections and it will  be interesting to identify interests or  individuals which try to torpedo this  measure.  The proposed bills are similar to  those in effect in Florida, Wisconsin  and Massachusetts. To those who  hopelessly state that these measures  will not succeed, the Florida experience is enlightening. Whereas prior to  the passage of this bill only $50,000  was reported for the election of a  United States senator, after its enactment the next election disclosed a total  expenditure of $500,000.  Here are the basic provisions of HB  12 and SB 12:  Applies to County Campaigns  1. It applies to any state-wide or  county-wide election which would include state and county officials and  candidates for Congress. It does not  apply to city or school elections. Regulations of campaign contributions for  city elections could be provided for  in a charter amendment.  2. It requires each candidate to  name a campaign treasurer who will  have the sole authority for receiving  campaign contributions, authorizing  expenditures, and making periodical  reports prior and following the primary and general elections. Also it  requires each candidate to name a  campaign depository to receive his deposits of campaign gifts.  3. It requires that each state and  county executive committee of a political party shall make a full report of  all money and other things of value  contributed to it, and all expenditures.  All individuals contributing more than  $500 shall be identified. One bill requires reporting on fund-raising dinners with a list of ticket purchasers.  4. It requires the same reports for  each organization, group or committee organized for the purpose of furthering or opposing political candidates with identification if their contribution is more than $100.  5. Any person contributing more  than $100 for the opposition to or promotion of a candidacy, shall sign a  statement that the contribution has not  been furnished by any other person or  group.  6. No incumbent office-holder nor  any employee of his office may use  the facilities of the office for the purpose of furthering the campaign.  7. Any anonymous contribution  shall be returned to the donor.  Requires Weekly Deposits  8. All weekly deposits made by the  campaign treasurer in the bank depository shall be accompanied by a statement containing the name and address  of each person or group contributing  more than $25.  9. No expenditure from the campaign fund may be made except  authorized by the campaign treasurer  and no expenditure can be made unless  funds are available.  10. Reports of expenditures and  disbursements shall be filed with the  County Auditor or the Secretary of  State with whom the declaration of  candidacy was filed, on the first Monday of each month between the appointment of the treasurer and the primary or general election; six days preceding the primary or general election  and not more than 15 days after these  elections. These reports shall be open  to public inspection.  11. All advertisements, billboards,  television and radio announcements  must be identified by the words, ""Paid  for by"" followed by the name and address of the campaign treasurer and  candidate.  12. Any violator of this act is guilty  of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable by a fine or imprisonment.

This results from a provision in the  bill that for five miles beyond the intake all the area and streams shall be  open to all comers. The State Pollution Commission is given the right to  establish certain rules and regulations  but the City Water Department officials point out that it would be absolutely impossible adequately to police  the large areas.  Here is the actual provision of this  proposed act.  Open to All  ""New Section, Sec. 1. The land and  waters of any watershed of any city,  town, municipal corporation or other  agency of the State of Washington, the  waters of which are utilized as a supply for human consumption, shall be  opened and accessible to the public  for any and all outdoor recreational  uses: PROVIDED, that no fishing,  boating, bathing or wading shall be  permitted in any such public water  supply, reservoir, spring, lake, pond,  or stream, or in any streams tributary  to the same, within a distance of five  miles as measured along the thread of  such stream or middle of the bed of  such impoundment from and above  the waterworks intake and point of  diversion of said waters into said public water supply distribution system.""  City Water Superintendent Ray  Heath points out that the threat to the  purity of the water not only affects  the water users inside the City of  Seattle, but many thousands east of  the lake or a grand total of about  808,000 people.  Opening the Cedar River and Tolt  River watersheds five miles beyond  the intake, would permit all of the  Cedar River and a substantial portion  of the Tolt River shed to be visited  by the general public, Heath said.  COUNCILMAN  BEST  REPLIES TO ""NEEDLE""  Replying to the critical ""Needles  and Orchids"" comment about the  $44,000 U. S. grant for the Don Ar-  mini Boat Landing development,  Councilman Ted Best made this  amiable response. ""Inasmuch as the  funds are there, and many cities are  lining up at the cashier's window, I  suppose we'd be severely criticized  for not getting our hands in the till.""  He pointed out that the ""$44,000  from Uncle Sam was not for hard-up  districts but rather from the H.H.F.A.  agency for cities to provide open  spaces.""  TteedUt  &lt;Zttct  CncfacU  ORCHIDS FOR McCRILLIS  The League has received letters  from the Woman's Century Club and  the Retired Officers' Association  thanking Frank McCrillis for his recent talks before them on the Seattle  Municipal League.  In the past six months, different  League speakers have given 28 talks  before service and other clubs  throughout the county. Among the  most popular subjects were talks  about the Municipal League, Air Pollution, and Port of Seattle. As a byproduct, these have yielded a few new  members and certainly have enlightened more people about the League.  The League still welcomes invitations for their speakers to impart information to all kinds of organizations  about current civic problems.  If your organization is looking for  a speaker, call the League office, MA  2-8333 and we'll try to supply a well-  informed person on a number of subjects. Just give us a week's time to  locate one.  by C.   A.  GROSSER  Executive Secretary  Ordinarily the League's County Planning Committee turns out rather well  for committee meetings. The meeting  on January 28 was an exception for only  five out of 119 enrolled on the committee attended a noon meeting to  hear Robert Richardson, superintendent  of King County Courthouse, and Dan  Murphy, the remodelling project supervisor, explain the enormous remodelling  job now going on there.  * *      *  Citizens are going to be interested  in the 1964 year-end profit and loss  statements of the facilities in the Civic  Center including the Opera House,  Coliseum, Exhibition Hall, Playhouse, Ice  Arena, and the Parking building. They  will be interested in knowing which of  these facilities show a profit and which  a loss and the overall profit and loss  for all these buildings.  * *      *  We gratefully recognize the service  by Jack Garrison on the Mayor's Citizens' Advisory Committee on Garbage  but we disagree with his contention that  the city could save money by operating  its own garbage collecting and disposal. He cited lower costs of lower  truck licenses, lower interest costs on  bonds and other items. But from long  contact around city halls, we believe  that these advantages are offset by the  absence of that ""profit prod"" which is  absent from municipal operations and  must be in a private organization. We  remember in one city where it operated  its garbage system, three men sat on  each truck with one doing nothing but  drive. In Seattle all the men unload  cans under the contract system.

Generally, garbage service fees paid to house-  to-house collectors in King County  outside of Seattle are $2.00 a month so  the local rate of $1.25 is low by comparison and is not likely to be raised  higher than $2.00 a month or even  less.

He explained that about a year ago  Governor Rosellini appointed a committee of 15 to inquire into this problem. Five of the members were Democrats, five Republicans and five were  members of the League of Women  Voters. Mrs. Harold Pearson, past  State President of the League of  Women Voters, was named chairman.  ""The voter certainly is entitled to  know who contributes,"" said Pritchard.

Don Leland, Port  counsel, explained this litigation to the  20 members of the League Port Committee at its meeting on Feb. 11.  General Manager Eldon Opheim  also described the program of capital  improvements at the Airport.  Jet Noises Are Gold to City  Although the jet noises may cost the  Port a considerable sum when householders under the flight path from a  half mile to a miles and a half from  the end zone, collect damages, these  same racuous sounds are worth millions to this community in the making  of planes and their in and out flying  from the Airport. Therefore Seattle-  ites could be a little tolerant of these  noises.  Here is the story of litigation as related by Port Attorney Leland.  He said in part: This litigation involves what are known as the ""noise  cases."" They disclose the growing  pains of our Airport. A few years ago  a number of residents who lived beyond the end of the runway and under  the flight-path, took a case to the King  County Superior Court alleging dam  ages to their property as a result of  the Airport noise. The State Supreme  Court ruled that they could recover if  they could prove that the noise from  too frequent direct over-flights impaired the value of their property.  However, the statute of limitations applied which outlawed some of the  cases.  New Cases Filed  With the coming of the louder noises  from jet planes, new cases were filed  in  1960.

If that has not transpired, League  members are urged to write the  Governor and members of the State  Legislature urging all possible speed  in completing this long overdue  action.  Already delays have impaired the  ability of the Legislature to give  adequate consideration to the many  measures before it.

The Municipal League of Seattle  and King County has long recognized the need for equitable realignment of the legislative districts in  the state and the attendant difficulty  of the self-surgery which this imposes on the Legislature. League  committees are continuing their  study to formulate what they believe are better redistricting procedures to avoid recurrence of this  inexcusable dilemma.

(Continued from Preceding Page)  preme Court ruled that the plaintiffs  had a good cause for action. They only  needed to prove that the noise resulted  in depreciation in their property. These  cases were appealed to the United  States Supreme Court which ruled it  would not consider the merits of pending cases at this time. The specific  damages in each case must be determined before the plaintiff can collect.  The cases are now back in the King  County Superior Court awaiting a determination as to whether or not some  or all of the 196 parcels have been  damaged. The Port Commission is  now having studies made by appraisers  to determine the approximate possible  damages. They have reported that  there has been no evidence of depreciating values in some parcels under the  flight pattern and in fact some values  have increased in recent sales. One  man built a pool. The damages are  determined by comparing the value of  land prior to the use of jet planes and  afterward.  If numerous plaintiffs are successful in obtaining damages many others  may start suits. All of the 196 cases  come from beyond the south end of  the runway. However, there are about  50 cases pending from the north end.  The total damages requested in this  suit amount to about $1,500,000 but  so far the appraisers estimate payment  of substantially lesser amounts to plaintiffs involved in the present suits. However, if more property owners complain and get judgments the cost may  run higher.  What Are Remedies  The Port Commission is studying  possible remedies. Maybe it must acquire tracts beyond the so-called ""clear  zone."" However, under present rules  the federal government has not participated in granting matching funds in  buying property to avoid noise damages.  If the Port acquires these tracts  and the houses are removed, the land  could be used for the following purposesÙ__golf links, county park, or industrial park. However, it is possible  that the Federal Aviation agency and  the county might participate in some  of this land acquisition.  In response to a question as to  whether or not the noise from jet  planes can be muffled, Airport Manager Don Shay said this has been  studied for some years but unfortunately any reduction in the ndjfb also  means a loss of power. Another listener inquired as to whether or not the  future supersonic planes will produce  more noise. Shay replied that is possible. However, they may not be required to utilize full power to rise aloft  where they would open up their engines for supersonic speed.  Airport Growth' and Improvement  General Manager Eldon Opheim  gave information about the capital  improvements at the Airport. He cited  the following statistics.  1949 length of runway. .   6,111 feet  1965 length of runway. .11,900 feet  1950 airplane loading  positions 9 .

As of Dec. 31, 1964, the  Airport has a valuation of $27,750,000  to which the United States government  has contributed $11,540,000 and the  Port of Seattle $16,210,000. At the  present time $3,865,000 worth of  work is in progress at the Airport with  an additional $1,745,000 scheduled in  the near future. By the end of 1965  we estimate that there will be a capital investment of $33,360,000 in the  Airport.  Here are some of the newimprove-  ments underway. A new restaurant is  being constructed which will have an  unobstructed view of the Airport operations. Additional land will be acquired for air cargo facilities.

The recommendation  was presented to the Board by Robert  E. Paulsen, chairman of the subcommittee.  Following is the recommendation:  1. Redistricting shall be based on  population figures contained in the  preceding federal census. A maximum  variation in size of 5 per cent of the  average obtained by dividing the total  state population by the number of legislative districts, is permitted.  2. Primary responsibility for redistricting shall remain in the hands of  the   Legislature,   which   shall  be   re  quired to redistrict no later than the  end of the second regular legislative  session next following a federal census.  3. If the Legislature fails to redistrict, or if a legislative redistricting  plan is found to be unconstitutional, a  commission, composed of one member selected by the state central committee of each of the major parties,  who shall be named within 30  days of the close of the session or the  date of the adverse court decision, and  one additional member selected by the  previously appointed members within  ten days thereafter, shall redistrict the  state. If the third member is not selected within the prescribed time limit,  the appointment shall be made by the  Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  The commission shall be required to  redistrict the state within 90 days  thereafter.   Subsequent action to en  sure compliance shall be determined by  the court.  4. Any redistricting plan adopted  by the Legislature shall be subject to  court review. Any redistricting proposal adopted by a redistricting commission shall be subject to review by  the State Supreme Court, which must  complete its review within 60 days.  5. The powers of initiative and referendum shall be preserved.  6. A statement of the state population as determined by the federal census, a computation of the proper size  of each legislative district determined  by dividing the total population of the  state by the total number of legislative  districts, and the percentage deviation  from this average for each legislative  district, shall be included in any redistricting plan adopted by the Legislature or a redistricting commission.  21,000  On  County  Relief  Roll  The King County welfare rolls    practically no changes in the number  contain about 21,000 cases who    of cases in 1964 as compared with  receive about $24,000,000 a year 1963 a*d the c™Ýst of about $2&gt;000&gt;000  .            .        , .    ,      n      -i a month was about the same.  support for various kinds of welfare,    according   to   the   King The number of individuals receiving  County branch of the State De- this aid is larger than the number of  partment of Public Assistance. cases because there are two or more  Their records show that there were recipients for many of the cases.

This is the proposed consolidation  of the 25 King County school districts  into one large district.  Arguments bristle on both sides  which need careful appraising by a  group of thoughtful citizens.  Attorney P. Cameron Devore is  chairman of this subcommittee.  Inasmuch as the entire county is involved, Mr. Devore and other members of his subcommittee, would like  to have more members from outlying  parts of the county in other school districts to get their points of view.  So, any League members living outside Seattle who would be interested  in serving on this subcommittee, please  notify the office and you will be enrolled.

Preempts Commercial Space  So, unless we have an adequate  mass transit system by that time, we  may have to construct many more  parking buildings which will preempt  the space which could better house  more productive stores and offices.  This was the ominous forecast by  Israel Gilboa, project manager for the  Puget Sound Regional Transit Survey  which is being prepared by the De-  Leuw, Cather & Company, consulting  engineers.  Mr. Gilboa was speaking before the  League's Utilities and Services Committee and Arterial Transportation  Subcommittee on January 22. He was  accompanied by John Porter, director  of the Puget Sound Governmental  Conference and C. D. Woolfall, resident engineer, Puget Sound Regional  Transit Plan.  John Porter, director of the Puget  Sound Governmental Conference, said  that several years ago his organization,  consisting of representatives of local  governments in the Puget Sound area,  acted as sponsor, with the State Highway Commission, of the Puget Sound  Regional Transportation Survey, which  is designed to make a comprehensive  study with recommendations concerning all phases of transportation in this  area.  Transit Study Authorized  In order to narrow this problem to  the aspects of regional and rapid transit, on July 1, 1964, the Puget Sound  Governmental   Conference   employed  DeLeuw, Cather & Company to make  a study of this problem and complete  its report by July, 1965 or as soon as  it could fully utilize data from the  Regional Transportation Study. This  consultant was given two assignments.  One was to make a study of the possibility of a rapid transit route on the  third bridge over Lake Washington  and second to make a report on future  rapid transit facilities in the Puget  Sound area.  Mr. Gilboa said in part. The DeLeuw, Cather & Company has been  in business 50 years making studies  and investigations and reports on public and private transportation. In preparing this report which is only partially finished, we contacted many  public officials and technical officials  to obtain information. We are using a  great deal of the data from the Regional Transportation Survey. Our  first step is to determine whether or  not this region can support an all-bus  rapid transit system. This could be  followed by a rail system in the future.  Population Distribution Ù__ We first  sought to find out the probable future  increases in population in the different areas between now and 1985.  These estimates are as follows:  Area east of Lake Washington, population increase 1961-85Ù__300%.  Population increase in Seattle 1961-  85Ù__3%.  Estimated population increase south  of Seattle 1961-85Ù__about 125%.  Employment Ù__ We next sought to  locate the heavy areas of employment  and have received forecasts as follows:  Downtown Seattle, 1961Ù__71,000  persons.  Downtown Seattle, 1985Ù__127,000  persons.  Duwamish Valley, 1961 Ù__ 92,000  persons.  Duwamish Valley, 1985 Ù__ 125,000  persons.  This gives us evidence upon which  we can base the future layout of rapid  transit lines.  We found that in downtown Seattle  about 40% of the employees use transit buses and 60% come in automobiles. We estimate about the same  percentage in 1985 without rapid transit facilities.  We found that there is a wide distribution of the homes of workers in  the industrial area. This would make it  practically impossible to forecast a  possible route into the industrial area  south of the city.  Tentative Rapid Transit Route Ù__  Based on the foregoing information,  we made out a tentative rapid transit  route which in general follows the  population corridors as follows.  Tentative Route  Starting at 102nd Street North, it  would travel south on its own right-  of-way between 8th and 10th and  would go under the Ship Canal by  tunnel, to Mercer, next to the Seattle  Center to downtown under Third Avenue; along the Freeway and across  the Lake Washington Bridge to Fac-  toria where it would turn north to  Bellevue.  It was tentatively estimated that for  the year 1985 the lake crossing section  of this system might carry about  15,000 commuters a day. It may carry  slightly more on the northern route to  Ballard.  Gilboa said: In a later phase of our  present survey we will determine  whether or not any rapid transit system is feasible. However, assuming  that it is, first would come a bus system which could be followed by electric trains either on two rails or a  monorail which could obtain a speed  of at least 80 miles an hour.  It would  (Continued on Page 32)  Page 28  MUNICIPAL NEWS",,,,,,,7/5/15,7/5/15,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p16118coll7/id/30,30,31.jp2,/p16118coll7/image/31.jp2,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=p16118coll7&CISOPTR=31&action=2&DMSCALE=10&DMWIDTH=10000&DMHEIGHT=10000&DMX=0&DMY=0,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=p16118coll7&CISOPTR=31&action=2&DMSCALE=100&DMWIDTH=10000&DMHEIGHT=10000&DMX=0&DMY=0

Bldg. Supt. Richardson Gives Assurance  That Original Estimate Will Be Adhered To  The big remodeling of the  King County Courthouse would  cost around $6,000,000, Robert  Richardson, Courthouse Building  Superintendent and former project supervisor, told the League's  County Planning Committee on  January 28. He was accompanied by Dan Murphy, project  manager who supplemented Mr.  Richardson's remarks.  Major Richardson pointed out that  allowance is usually made for a 10%  increase in final costs over the original  estimate because of change orders, but  he pointed out that so far such increase in this job is only about 3%.  Exceeds Library Cost  To gain an idea as to the huge outlay for this remodeling job, its $6,-  000,000 cost exceeds by about  $1,000,000 the entire cost of the new  Public Library. It will also be larger  than the cost of the City Light Building remodeling and the new Municipal  Building. However, Major Richardson  pointed out that when this modernization is completed, the County Building will be worth up to $30,000,000.  The League was gratified when the  County Commissioners, some months  ago, appointed Major Richardson as  Clerk of the Works or Project Manager who will report directly to the  County Commissioners. Thus he will  keep the officials informed who are  responsible for raising the money for  this job and who are inclined to hold  costs down. Since our experience with  the Public Safety and City Light  Buildings, whose final costs were far  in excess of the original estimates, the  League has been much concerned and  watchful over the costs of new public  buildings.  Financed by Bond Issue  This project will be financed by a  $6,000,000 bond issue authorized by  the County Commissioners without a  vote of the people. Of this, three  issues have already been sold including $300,000 in 1962; $600,000 in  1963, and $3,000,000 in 1964.  Major Richardson said in part: ""In  1914 the county offices moved from  the old courthouse on the side of Profanity Hill to the present building  which was then only five stories. In  1928, work was started to raise it to  12 stories and was completed in 1930.  Since then practically nothing has been  done to the building in major repairs  and upkeep.  ""Almost all the major utilities have  deteriorated alarmingly, particularly  with respect to electrical wiring,  plumbing, etc.,"" Richardson said.  ""The air conditioning for the building  which was never correctly designed, is  bad and operating only 15 to 20% of  its capacity.  Decided to Modernize  ""In 1961, with the city intending to  build a new Municipal Building a  block away, the County Commissioners decided to modernize the King  County Courthouse. One of the first  jobs was to sandblast and steam clean  the structure. Also a large portion of  the fourth floor was completely remodeled. However, because of the  slow progress which the County Commissioners felt was a result of the  many separate contracts, they decided  to let a general contract to cover the  complete construction project.  ""It was decided to complete the  work in two phases. The contract for  Phase 1 was let in May, 1964 to Jen-  toft and Forbes. The major items in  Phase 1 were: demolition work to get  ready for Phase 2; complete and replace all utility systems and construct  a new mezzanine floor between the  old first and second floors on the  Third Avenue side of the building  which will add about 30,000 square  feet of floor space. Other Phase 1  changes include replacement of the  freight and jail elevators; a new mechanical penthouse on the roof to  house the new air conditioning apparatus.""  Major Richardson said that bids  for the Phase 2 contracts for the completion of the building would be let  around March 15, 1965 with work to  start about May 1, 1965. Phase 1 is  from 70 to 80% completed at this  time.  May Add Stories  The foundations in both the north  and south courts of the building are  being enlarged and reenforced so that  additional stories can be added to enclose these courts as space is needed.  Project Manager Murphy then amplified other points. The approximate  cost of all the work up to this January  is about $2,000,000. The approximate  completion date for Phase 2 will be  in early 1969. Included in Phase 2  will be the modernizing of the jail.  LEAGUE APPROVES TRANSIT  GAS TAX EXEMPTION  Renewal of the exemption of fuel  used by Seattle City Transit and other  similar utilities throughout the state,  from the state gas tax, was approved  by the League Legislative Committee,  James R. Ellis, chairman. This exemption must be authorized by the  Legislature every two years and so requires an official renewal at this  session of the Legislature. While this  exemption amounts to a saving to the  Seattle Transit of a little over  $100,000, yet it is one of those which  help reduce the transit deficit.

Few citizens realize what a large  sum is actually appropriated yearly by  the city for this purpose and how  much the city has actually expended  in capital improvements on such projects as the International Fountain, the  Public Library embellishments and the  rest.  In order to come closer to the actual  amount, Howard Embree, assistant  City Council budget officer, prepared  a tabulation which was presented at a  joint meeting of the League's City  Planning and City Operations Committee on January 29.  Embree points out that a total of all  these figures cannot be taken because  they represent a mixture of annual appropriations and capital outlay but  when one scrutinizes these expenditures individually one gets an idea of  the substantial amount expended by  the city.  It is likely that this sum will grow  from year to year because as cities  grow into maturity following the pattern of European communities, more  and more money is spent on cultural  and aesthetic embellishments.

Ludwig Lobe, wellknown local  C. P. A. and chairman of the  State Citizens Advisory Council  on Public Welfare, cited this as  a formula for reducing welfare  costs before the League's Public  Health and Assistance Committee January 27.  The advisory committee, authorized  by the 1963 legislature, employed  Greenleigh Associates, consultants, to  make a study of the public assistance  service in this state and offer recommendations for improvement.  The consulting firm came up with  several hundred recommendations  which were condensed by the Citizens  Committee to 10 as follows:  1. Adequate assistance grants to  maintain minimum levels of health and  decency for all eligible needy persons.  The report charges that per family  grants are below levels of suitable sub-  sistance.  2. A full range of social services to  promote prevention of dependency and  facilitate self-care and self-support. Insufficient emphasis is now placed on  rehabilitation.  3. Changes in the eligibility requirements to take full advantage of federal  funds. Some available federal grants  are not made use of.  Mandatory Health Services Needed  4. Mandatory necessary medical,  dental and other health services including dentures, glasses, etc. to enable  the handicapped to find employment.  A boy will drop out of high school because of shame at his poor teeth. An  inadequate 35 cents a month allowance  for dental work is now granted. A  pair of glasses would help a woman  find work which she cannot now obtain from welfare. Failure to make a  small investment may keep this woman  on relief at a cost of several thousand  dollars a year.  5. A full range of child welfare  services including a complete health  program, and protective services for  abused children and those in danger  from becoming dependent.  6. Vocational and on-the-job training and employment counseling for  adult welfare recipients.  7. Better coordination of services  provided by State, Federal and private  agencies at all levels.  8. Reasonable and realistic salaries  for the personnel of the Department of  Public Assistance. The beginning social worker gets $400 less a year than  the gardener on the State House lawn  in Olympia, said Lobe.  9. Modernization and streamlining  of the organizational structure of the  department.  10. Legislation permitting a single  budget appropriation for the department but giving the director, with the  concurrence of the Central Budget  Department, authority to shift items internally to meet foreseeable deficits.  Lobe said that under the present  budget practice if an unexpended balance remains in one item, instead of  being shifted to another which is short,  it is transferred to the general fund.  This has resulted in cutting grants to  clients, said Lobe.  He said the State is spending 12 per  cent less on statewide welfare than it  did 10 years ago. He said the survey  estimated that 85 per cent of those on  relief are either too old, too young or  too ill to be employable at this time.  However, 25 per cent of these could  be returned to employment in a year  with proper rehabilitation.  He added that the State of Illinois  has discovered that by spending more  to rehabilitate clients, it spent less in  later years.  The League committee decided to  have its Planning Subcommittee study  the Greenleigh report.  TleectteA  GAtct  CsicfccU  by C.   A.  CROSSER  Executive Secretary  At a low point in one of the garbage  disposal conferences at the Ci+y Hall,  one frustrated soul whispered to another,  ""Maybe all these composting, barging  and hauling methods will be outdated in  the next 20 years by this one. Suppose  the city loads a large rocket with all the  day's collection of garbage and shoots  it off into space toward the moon, Mars  or the sun. It can then go sailing around  for a million years because there is  plenty of room up there without disturbing any adjoining property owners  except Martians or the sun could burn  it up as an incinerator.  * *      *  The rise and ebbing of the Order of  Cincinnatus during the mid 1930s certainly deserves a study by some local  inquirer and writer of Seattle history.  As Historian Toynbee points out, it was  a response to an upsurge of low political  conditions around here. Who were the  young leaders of Cincinnatus? What did  they accomplish? Why did their ardor  diminish? This is a fertile and interesting field for a research project in a local  political science.  * *      *  We note the introduction of a bill  in the legislature which would give all  employees two hours off to vote prior  to primary and general elections. It  strikes us that for the 300,000 persons  gainfully employed in this county, this  would mean a tremendous loss of time  in factories, offices and shops. After  all, the polls are open until 8 p.m. It  would seem that the voter should feel  some responsibility to exert himself to  vote.

While we have noticed a vast improvement in the operations and policies  of the Port of Seattle in the past 20 years we are now wondering as to precisely  what are its goals or the limits to the physical facilities which it could acquire  or construct in the next decade.  How many docks is the Port of Seattle planning to modernize? For how  many ships does it plan to provide dock accommodations making allowance for  a reasonable increase in maritime commerce in the next 25 years? Does the  Port plan to acquire the entire waterfront? With the 2-mill Duwamish Industrial Improvement tax levy having only three more years to run, will that complete the financing of this worthy project which is designed to provide a substantial area for future industries in the Duwamish valley? How much longer  is the Port going to levy an additional 2 mills for waterfront improvements  which has been used to finance the modernization of many docks and permits  a partial pay-as-you-go policy which saves interest? However, as with a home,  there is a limit to improvements. Has the Port Commission specific goals or  limitations to their development program?  The Booz, Allen and Hamilton, consulting engineers^ included in their  recommendations (1) that the Port should establish a set of objectives so that  the citizens might know the directions in which the Port is moving together with  their proposed accomplishments. Also a few years ago, a subcommittee of the  League Port Committee, including Adm. Zeusler and Frank Kitchell, now member of the Port Commission, drafted a tentative statement of goals which is  still on ice.  Therefore, we respectfully call this uncompelted project to the attention  of the Port of Seattle Commission.  430,000 or about $700,000 a year in  payment from patients.  The per patient day cost in the  County General Hospital is $40.39  which is much lower than the 11 hospital average in Western Washington  of $55.32.  Therefore, feeling that the cut made  by the State Department of Public Assistance is too much, the King County  Hospital Board has asked the Legislature for a restoration of $603,000 of  the $2.1 million cut by the State Department.  Far Behind In Equipment  The Hospital Board members state  a number of arguments justifying its  budget requests. They claim that the  King County Hospital is far behind in  its replenishment of equipment and  maintenance of the building. The annual average allowance for this purpose here has been about 1.6 per cent  of the total budget compared with an  average of about 5 per cent in other  hospitals. While the number of patients has remained fairly stationary,  yet a good part of the budget increase  results from increasing the salaries of  nurses included in the 901 employes of  the hospital.  One of the most important reasons  advanced by the Board of Hospital  Trustees for its budget requests is to  maintain the present high standards of  the King County Hospital as a teaching and research institution. It has the  unusual advantage of having many of  the staff of the University School of  Medicine work on treatment and research in the King County Hospital  which gives patients the benefit of a  high degree of professional knowledge  and skill.

With some 1,250 bills and 125 resolutions and memorials still before the Legislature,  little more than confusion can be expected.  While under the terms of the court order a good deal  of basic committee work was done, the normal urgency  of the legislative session was absent.

Immediately upon the removal of the court ban Monday morning problems in the Rules of the Senate and  L     L      L   L    L I L  MilÙ__Hi  House became apparent. These were quickly remedied and  business as usual ensued.  Bills Will Retain Same Status  With only a few days remaining and only a small fraction of work accomplished, the status of the special session  is assumed of paramount importance.  Among the proposals in consideration is one to introduce all bills from the regular into the special session with  the same bill numbers. Among other things, this will save  a great deal of printing costs and time.  It has also been proposed that bills be carried over  from the regular to the special session so that a bill  which is passed by one house will keep its status in the  special session. If these proposals are followed the special  session could be merely a substitute regular session.  In any case, few reject the concept that it will be a long  winter and spring in Olympia this year.  SAYS ATTORNEY BELL:  OPEN WATER-SHEDS POSE NO  DANGER TO CITY WATER SUPPLIES  Because of the unnecessary  prohibition against the general  public coming into the Seattle  and Tacoma watersheds in King  County, about one-quarter of the  county is closed to visitors and  public recreation.  This was charged by Attorney Lewis  Bell of Everett, chairman of the Lands  Committee of the Washington State  Sportsmen's Council before the  League's Utilities and Service Committee on February 18.  Mr. Bell gave the other side of the  open - watershed   controversy.    The  League committee had previously  heard City Water Superintendent Ray  Heath and Assistant Superintendent  Jerry Allen, voice their objection to a  bill in the Legislature which would  open public watersheds to the general  public.  Mr. Bell admitted that every additional visitor to a watershed adds to  the health hazard but he contended  that at the worst the treatment cost  wouldn't be more than about 20 cents  per family per month.  By slides, he sought to prove that  present logging operations in the Cedar  River Watershed bring many persons  into the area and no harm to the water  has resulted.  He said that all the epidemics in  large cities since 1900 started from  impurities in the distribution system  and not in the sources of the water.  Dr. Halliday, member of the Legislative Committee of the King County  Medical Society, said he didn't believe  the open watershed bill would pass this  session but he pointed out that this  matter is likely to come up again and  again. He thought that the Municipal  League could perform a service by  making a comprehensive report with  substantiating facts, and possibly with  a recommendation as to whether or  not the watershed should be opened.

However, although the League lost members  during this depression period, it  carried on as a vigorous defender  of democracy and good government and emerged from this  decade stronger than ever.  Sag in Local Government  This ten year period opened with  local government suffering a sag in  ethical standards. The MUNICIPAL  NEWS of Dec. 2, 1933, said, ""That  Seattle is experiencing a crime wave is  not surprising when the pendulum  of public opinion has swung against  all public control of morals and has  sanctioned uncontrolled gambling,  drinking and lack of law enforcement.""  The News stated later, ""County government in this state is as definitely  outdated as the horse and buggy. It  is wasteful, slow moving, an incubator  of unsound politicians and an obstacle to expert, centralized administration of public finance.""  Rise of John C. Stevenson  This period saw the rise of John C.  Stevenson, who, it was said, had ambitions to become the ""Boss"" Pender-  gast or Hague in our local politics  and government. As a member of the  Board of County Commissioners, he  controlled that body and the NEWS  charged him with trying to reach into  our city government and the county  hospital. During this time our city  government was burdened with a tremendous deficit and the street-car sys-  ter was limping fiscally.  What a contrast with the higher  standards of our present civic scene!  Maybe    we    should    appreciate    our  present blessings.  A further dark cloud on our horizon  was the depression and the great number of unemployed persons in this city  who caused an ominous disturbance in  our local economy.  In the fall of 1930, the League became interested in the scheme of  permanent registration for elections.  Prof. Joseph P. Harris of the Political  Science Department of the University  of Washington, at the annual meeting  of the League on November 25, described this procedure which was designed to replace the cumbersome  registration before every election.  Current League Projects  Current League projects at that time  included permanent registration for  elections; county-city consolidation,  budget reform; ten-year plan for capital expenditures and the city manager  plan.  The year 1934 saw the rise of the  Order of Cincinnatus, which was described in the issue of the MUNICIPAL NEWS, Jan. 27, as follows:  ""New civic order attracting high  type of youth,"" ran the headline. The  article went on, ""A group of active  young Seattle men, firmly convinced  that our governments need an injection of practical idealism, have formed  a new Order of Cincinnatus."" The  rise and ebbing of this co-called order  was a direct response to the low political conditions of the period and it  certainly contributed toward clearing  up the civic atmosphere.  As a result of the March 17 election,  the MUNICIPAL NEWS said that by  rejecting the incumbent Mayor and  members of the City Council, School  Board,   and   Port   Commission   who  sought re-election, Seattle voters effectively demonstrated their dissatisfaction with local government. Their  places were filled by candidates endorsed by Cincinnatus.  The 1936 pre-election report on  candidates for city offices altered its  method of labelling candidates by employing the terms, ""Qualified,"" which  gave it the color of being a ""slate."" In  the fall General Election, the report  carried a genuine League slate when  some candidates were recommended.  This policy was discontinued a few  years later.  President Hare Flares Out  Flaring out at local civic conditions,  new League President Arthur N. Hare,  in the July 4, 1936 issue of the MUNICIPAL NEWS, said, ""We are all experts on the League of Nations, foreign  relations or the Ethiopian situation and  what Hitler and Mussolini may do to  each other, but either we do not know  what is going on in this town or we do  not care.  ""Take the racketeering going on in  pinball machines and their ilk, Chinese  and other gambling houses, horse racing, the loan shark racket, the business  chance racket, the industrial shakedown of both employee and employees,  the real estate racket, the insurance  rackets, abortions and narcotics, bootlegging, the nightclub rackets, not to  mention scores of others.""  The December 19, 1936 issue of the  NEWS says the Municipal League decided to admit women and as a result  made its plans to attract women to  membership.  The results of the 1938 spring election caused the MUNICIPAL NEWS  to crow in its March 12 issue as follows,   ""The   election   proves   triumph  (Continued on Last Page)  Page 36  MUNICIPAL NEWS",,,,,,,7/5/15,7/5/15,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p16118coll7/id/39,39,40.jp2,/p16118coll7/image/40.jp2,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=p16118coll7&CISOPTR=40&action=2&DMSCALE=10&DMWIDTH=10000&DMHEIGHT=10000&DMX=0&DMY=0,http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=p16118coll7&CISOPTR=40&action=2&DMSCALE=100&DMWIDTH=10000&DMHEIGHT=10000&DMX=0&DMY=0

A. Anderson, director of operations for the Engineering Department of the City of Seattle.  Editor's Note: The aphorism of  making a purse out of a sow's ears is  applicable to a city as well as to an  individual. D. A. Andersen, director  of operations for the City Engineering  Department, epitomizes this in his listing of the numerous valuable areas in  the city which cover former garbage  dumps. Their offensive appearance  and even worse odors were the object  of hatred by neighbors. But now in  total they have contributed many valuable acres to the physical area of the  city.  * * *  For the past hundred years,  since its incorporation in 1865,  Seattle has provided ideal locations for garbage disposal landfill.  When a city has hills and valleys,  large tideflat areas, and numerous  marshy locations along its lake fronts,  it is made-to-order for reclamation of  its land for more useful purposes. This  has been the situation in Seattle since  its earlier history.  Here are some of the locations  where major refuse fills have been or  are being madeÙ__thereby converting  land into valuable sites for many purposes.  Made New Industrial Sites  The huge tideflat area south of  Jackson Street and west of Beacon  Hill, which is the present location of  one of our major industrial sections,  was a fill site. I can still remember  roaming around this area about 1910  when all streets were on timber trestles  and tidal waters covered the entire  area most of the time. Numerous refuse fills were being made here at that  time.  I also personally recall the refuse  fills made in the vicinity of Sixth Avenue south, south of Spokane Street,  now also used for industrial purposes.  Other large refuse fills were made  west of Sick's Rainier Brewery. All  these old refuse disposal sites are now  used as industrial sites.  The present West Seattle tidal fill,  north of Southwest Spokane Street  and east of Harbor Avenue will be  completed this year. The Port of  Seattle has plans to utilize this large  area as a valuable addition to the  Port's shoreside warehouse facilities.  Fills In Rainier Valley  In Rainier Valley, an area was filled  around the Public Library in what was  then known as Columbia City. Also  at South Genesee and 45th Avenues  South, there is a large sanitary landfill  which is likely to be completed this  year. A portion of this fill between  Stan Sayres hydrofoil pits and South  Genesee Street has already been turned  over to the Park Department. Disposal  fills have been made in marshy ground  along the south shore of Lake Union.  These areas are now being used for  industrial sites, Naval Reserve installation and the city asphalt plant. A number of refuse fills are also made in  marshy ground along the south and  east shores of Lake Union. These  completed fills are now being used for  Park Department playfields, field  houses and a small pitch and putt golf  course.  A former dump site in lower Ra-  vena Park has been converted for a  playfield.  At the Interbay disposal site lying  north of Pier 91 Naval Station between  Magnolia Bluff and Queen Anne Hill,  another large landfill is nearing com-  pltion. This is a low-lying former tidal  area filled and made available for recreational purposes. It has been turned  over to the Park Department and is  now being used as a small, nine-hole  golf course and driving range under  private operation.  Biggest Landfill Site  Just east of the University of Washington lies Seattle's largest landfill site  with the possible exception of the  south industrial area. It has not yet  been completed. This area north of  the University of Washington Stadium  and east of Montlake Boulevard received two-thirds of Seattle's refuse.  The University Regents, who previously ordered a cessation of dumping by  the City of Seattle this year, has extended it one year to permit the city  to develop its disposal plan. This  reclamation project has provided the  University of Washington with many  acres of land which is now being used  for parking purposes, tennis courts,  canoe house and canoe channels with  many other future uses planned by  the University.  East of Aurora in the vicinity of  North 125th Street, there is a completed refuse landfill at the site of the  former King County Shop Headquarters. After annexation of this area, the  city completed the fill and constructed  the Engineering Department Haller  Lake headquarters on the north end.  The main portion of the completed fill  has been sold to private individuals  and future use has not yet been determined.  The foregoing demonstrates quite  clearly the great benefits the city may  derive by converting otherwise useless  land to useful purposes. In many  cases, this results in placing property  back on the tax rolls and returning  revenues to the city. The value of the  land thus reclaimed would obviously  run into millions of dollars.

One of these was the 1962 city  charter amendment which allowed the  Civil Service Commission to waive the  Seattle residence preference over those  living in Bellevue and other places.  Capable Recruits Live in Suburbs  This has helped the city hire better  professional and technical personnel  including patrolmen and firemen. City  Light was able to select the best data  processing manager; senior mechanical  engineer, and an electric station supervisor who lived outside the city but  could be immediately appointed under  the charter amendment.  The City Engineering Department  has hired desirable engineers who lived  outside Seattle who would have been  lost in previous years.  It is estimated that some 180 city  appointments have been improved because of this charter change. It is  easier for the city to recruit men who  can meet the high standards that the  city now sets for patrolmen and police  cadets. More nonresidents are applying for jobs where they can compete  on an equal basis.  City Residents Appointed First  Prior to the charter amendment,  candidates for city jobs were divided  into two groups. One included persons living in the city, and the other  were outsiders. All those on the city  eligible list had to be appointed before  anyone was picked from the nonresident group. Thus on a 1960 patrolman examination, 53 residents and 41  nonresidents passed and all the residents were required to be hired before  any nonresident could be appointed.  Twenty residents with scores of 70 to  80, got jobs before five outsiders with  a superior score of over 90. Outsiders  with higher marks frequently took  other jobs before they were called and  so were lost to the city.  Some Jobs Still Limited  There are a number of beginning  positions in the city service that are  still limited to residents only. There  is a surplus of applicants for laborers,  clerks, janitors and warehousemen.  The Commission has the discretion to  limit applications for examination to  residents when little would be gained  by inviting more candidates from outside.  Thus, due partly to the League's  effort, the city charter was amended  in 1962 so the Civil Service Commission can now waive the residence preference in recruiting when such action  will help the city. It is certain that  more and better public service will be  provided for each tax dollar if more  public servants are hired on the basis  of merit rather than some qualification that is unrelated to job preference.  SMALL  INCREASE  IN  LOCAL   1964  CRIME  The comprehensive report of  the Seattle Police Department,  discloses only a small five per  cent increase in Part I offenses  (these include the seven major  crimes) during 1964 as compared to 1963.  The 1964 report disclosed 11,710  serious offenses reported as compared  to 11,206 a year before.  Increases over the previous year  were reported for murder, forceable  rape, aggravated assault and larceny  of $50 or over.  Decreases were reported in negli  gent manslaughter, robbery,  assaults,  burglary and auto theft.  The charges involving drunk driving and drunkenness showed a decrease.  In 1964 there was a 13 per cent  increase in juvenile arrests totalling  1875. The report stated that ""juveniles were responsible for 39 per cent  of all Part I offense clearances.""  Traffic Law Enforcement Statistics  In 1964, 114,884 hazardous traffic  violations were reported which was a  1 per cent reduction under the  previous year.  Eighty-seven per cent of the murder and manslaughter complaints were  cleared by arrest in 1964. Thirty per  cent of the 491 robbery complaints  were cleared and only 19 per cent of  the burglary complaints.  Twenty-six per cent of all the Part  I complaints were cleared in 1964  which is 1 per cent greater than the  year before.  ATLANTA VOTERS APPROVE  RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM  The enterprising metropolitan  area of Atlanta, Ga., is another  community which has taken steps  to provide rapid transit as a  means for speeding up the movement of people between their  homes and work.  In November 1964, the voters of  the five counties which comprise  Metropolitan Atlanta, endorsed by a  vote of two to one, enabling legislation permitting the creation of the  Rapid Transit Authority by the  Georgia General Assembly.  A plan for a mass transit system  for the five-county area was formulated in 1962 by the Atlanta Regional  Metropolitan Planning Commission.  The proposed system would consist of  66 miles of double track, grade separated, electrified railway with 42 stations.

E. Bernard, League  member and sufferer from jet  noises, wrote us a vigorous letter  giving the other side of a story  about airplane noises which appeared in the MUNICIPAL  NEWS of Feb. 22.  ""Industry is not allowed to pollute  the air and water at will in enlightened  communities simply because it is  cheap and convenient to do this,""  writes Mrs. Bernard, ""Noise is a form  of pollution which should be subjected  to similar regulation.  ""I have just read the MUNICIPAL  NEWS' sneering article pooh-poohing  the claims of property owners near the  Seattle-Tacoma Airport asking damages for the results of jet noise."" (Ed.  noteÙ__Living in Magnolia, we also  have noticed jet noises but not at the  decibels Mrs. Brown and her neighbors hear, and so we certainly didn't  intend to sneer.)  Mrs. Bernard continues. ""Believe  me, if the writer of that article had  ever spent a night in the 'flight pattern'  the tone of his remarks would be entirely different.  ""The fact is that most flights, or  many of them, take off after nine  o'clock. They also take off wholesale  before nine in the morning. I have  counted them at the rate of six in as  many minutes during one of those  'Roman candle' periods.  ""Property owners generally do NOT  know what they are getting into until  after they have moved into their happy  new homes. Many a sale has been  killed if the burst of jet take-offs happens to occur as they are about to  write a check and sign the earnest  money agreement.""  City householders who now pay $1.25  a month for their present garbage service and face an increase to $1.75 to  $2.00 a month because of the new disposal program, also pay a few cents a  month for the county garbage disposal  service for their suburban friends. The  1965 King County appropriations for its  Department of Sanitation which includes  the disposal of garbage from the other  cities and incorporated areas east of  Lake Washington, amounts to about  $907,000. From this is deducted $201,-  000 for capital outlay and $150,000 a  year which the private collectors who  make the house-to-house collections, pay  the county on 10% of their collections.  Of the $550,000 deficit coming from  the county general fund, householders  in the City of Seattle who receive no  benefits from this service, pay 60% or  about $330,000 a year.  *      *      *  Recently we noticed a press item that  a graduate student from the University  of Indiana made a research report on  crime conditions in the city of Gary.

Beginning of League Staff  The May 21, 1938 issue of the  NEWS announced that as a result of a  money-raising membership campaign  conducted by J. W. Clise, Jr., L. Murray Grant, Winlock Miller, Jr. and  Fred Burwell, the League now has  funds available to hire a full-time executive secretary. Under the leadership of A. J. Quigley the League's  Membership Committee conducted a  campaign raising the total membership  by 214 to more than 500. This resulted in the appointment of Glen  Eastburn as the first full-time executive secretary.  In the spring of 1939, Ewen C.  Dingwall, University of Washington  Journalism graduate, was employed as  editor of the MUNICIPAL NEWS,  succeeding Murray Morgan.  As the result of more intensive  research made possible by the staff  increase, the NEWS of March 18  stated, ""The Municipal League opens  fire on King County purchasing practices."" As a sequel, five years later,  the 1945 Legislature enacted a League-  drafted measure requiring centralized  county purchasing.  As a further step to build up membership, Albert F. Hull, former Mar-  shalltown, la. businessman was appointed Membership Secretary of the  League in May, 1939. With his  ""green thumb"" membership was expanded to 5200 in 1952.  The decade started with 470 members which slumped to 345 in 1938  and as a result of a brisk membership-  getting effort at the end of the decade,  was raised to 682 in 1940.

It may be hoped that this measure will  be smothered.  *        *        *  Ever hear of ""Annexation Indigestion""? We shouldn't be surprised that  some of our surrounding cities may find  themselves suffering from this affliction  when they try to digest the large areas  of thinly-settled residence districts which  they have recently annexed. Soon will  come the clamor from these people for  the same standard of public services  which citizens in the original city receive. This will mean an expensive installation of widely-scattered public  services in these new areas without a  large high-value central business district  which can supply added revenue.
