No. 1  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, MARCH 6, 1924  PRICE 5 CENTS  REFLECTIONS  |  Constitution Violators  Know Nothing Party  American Protective Association  Ku Klux Klan  By Philip Tworoghr  Article VI of the Constitution of  the United States provides, "Thai no  religious test shall ever be required  as qualifications for any publio office  '"' public trust under the United  States".  At various times during the 185  years of our National life, organizations and societies sprang into ex-  istence to nullify that section of the  Constitution and limit, if possible,  those eligible to hold public office to  native-born Americans of the Prot-  estantfaith. While they have usually  had a rather short and ephemeral existence and have gone to an early  and dishonored grave, they have,  Nevertheless, during (heir short and  '"glorious career, caused considcr-  "''le I rouble and disturbance.  The first of these parlies was the  °'d "American Party", or as it was  called in its day "Know Nothing  "arty", It sprang into existence in  the early Fifties, by reason of the  large influx of i ligrants from Continental Europe, which followed the  unsuccessful attempts at Revolution in 1848, and the Irish famine in  the late forties.   ,Its strength  was  limited  to New  England,  Maryland,  1 irginia and Kentucky. In New  England il was direoted againsl the  Irish immigrants and the Catholic  Church and appealed sufficiently to  the befogged public mind l,o elect a  cobbler, named Gardner, as Govern-  ori and in addition to that, various  local officers. In Maryland, Virginia and Kentucky the movement  Was due to the faot that the German  ""migrants, a. great number of whom  Settled in those stales, were Unable  to see the blessings of negro slavery.  '" those slates it  succeeded in elect-  lng a few members of Congress and  came within a very close margin of  electing a Governor of Virginia in  J.866. The disorganization of political parties which followed the death  (,l the old Whig party may have had  a great deal to do with its temporary  strength. The greater issues, which  eventually brought about the Civil  "ar, contributed to the absolute  demise. 0f the "Know Nothing Party"  111 the late fifties.  The next, movement of this kind,  1)11 a National scale, was the organization known as the "American  Protective Association" or the "A.  * ■ A.", which sprang into being  about the middle eighties and dis-  "Ppearecl as a result of the McKinlcy-  oryan campaign in 1896. It had  considerable strength throughout the  north and was directed primarily  against the Catholics, giving as a  reason for its existence the control  °f our larger cities by politicians of  foreign birth and extraction and the  corruption then prevailing. Its membership was limited almost, entirely  to cities and it, succeeded in electing  Mayors in many of them. The ze-  "llli of its power was reached between 1893 and 1895, during which  tune it was instrumental  in electing  Mayors in Boston, Baltimore, Chi-  °agO, Kansas City, Mo., and many  smaller towns. All of the offioials  elected by it, failed to be re-elected  and soon "A. P. A.-ism" and the  individuals prominent in it sank into  "inocuous desuetude."  Continued on page 5  J.C.R.S.

C. It. S. because of lack of  accommodations. It is primarily to  secure these accommodations that  the present, drive is being conducted.  The J. C. it. 8. was organized in  1904 with an initial fund of $1.10.  Today it is the largest institution of  its kind in the world and has a yearly budget of $500,000. The institution has admitted and taken care of  more than 5,000 cases, in most instances having returned its patients  to society as happy and healthy men,  women and ohildren.  Dr. Spivak Founder  Dr. Spivak is the founder of the  J. C. It. S. and its present Secretary.  He has given his entire time and  fortune that the institution might  live. He is recognized as an authority in the field of medicine in the.  United States, having contributed  several articles to the National Medical Journal on subjects on which he  addressed the American Medical Association at San Francisco in 1923.

The movement among the lawyers is  modeled along the lines which have  been successfully followed by the  American Jewish Physicians' Committee of which Dr. Nathan Ratnoff  of New York is the President and  which has already bought a large  tract of land on the Mount of Olives  where the building of a Medical College is now being constructed and is  scheduled to open next June.  The President, in his letter addressed to Max Levy of New York,  Secretary of the Lawyers' Committee, speaks of the movement as "one  Which cannot, but appeal to the public imagination" and in line with the  movement, "to restore Palestine as a  centre of progress". Chief Justice  Tall, expresses the hope I hat the  proposed School of Law will "contribute to the peaoe of the world".  SEATTLE LODGE, I. O. B. B. CONDEMS JOHNSON  IMMIGRATION  MEASURE  The following resolution, voicing opposition to the Johnson  Immigration Bill, was ordered sent to Washington's representatives in Congress at the last meeting of Seattle Lodge,  I. O. B. B.:  "BE IT RESOLVED that although wc are in favor of  a fair immigration law barring undesirable immigrants, we  are opposed to the Johnson Immigration Bill now pending  in Congress because in its effect, if not in its purpose, it will  bar from this country, men and women of certain nationalities  and creeds irrespective of their individual desirability, and  favor immigrants from other countries regardless of their  individual undcsirability.  "BE IT RESOLVED FURTHER that we appeal to  the Representatives of our district in Congress ami the  Senators from our State to lend their aid in the enactment of  immigration law which will be more just in its provisions."  Latest J. T. A. Bulletins  DAVIS ANSWERS CHARGE OF PREJUDICE AGAINST JEWS  Cleveland, February 26 (J. T. A.)—Solomon Ulmer, local Jewish leader  and philanthropist, has received a long letter from Secretary of Labor Davis expressing deep concern over Ulmer's direct accusation that he is prejudiced against, Jews. Mr. Davis cites various instances showing that in  his office he has always been helpful and friendly to people of the Jewish  race and has often been bitterly denounced for overstepping the authority  of the law in cases of Jewish immigrants. "The. laws regulating immigration arc made by Congress", writes Mr. Davis, "and I as a sworn officer  would be a traitor to my country and a violator of my oath if I were not to  enforce the. laws given me by Congress."

QUIET IN UKRAINE  Bucharest, February 23 (Jewish Telegraphic Agency)—Neither anti-  Semitic unrest nor pogroms exist in the Ukraine, according to the SIGUR-  ANZA, published every Wednesday in Kishinev. The statement is made  that there has been no disturbance in Ukraine or for that matter within a  hundred kilometers of the Dneister boundary.  The Roumanian Government, nevertheless, is guarding very closely its  side of the Dneister in order to prevent Jewish refugees from the districts  where the disturbances have been reported, from crossing info Roumania.  It also appears that the rumor that thousands of homeless .lews had gathered on the Ukrainian side of the Dneister, awaiting an opportunity to cross,  is false.

MAYOR BROWN  There can be no question lhat Mayor  Brown has given a good business administration. Seattle is prosperous.  People are spending their money here.  They are buying Seattle's goods. Her  bank deposits are gaining $2,()()0,()00.00  per month. She is gaining 3,000 per  month in population. January, 1924,  usually a dull month, has been a  record breaker.  Of the two candidates, Dr. Brown  will be the best mayor. J le is one of  the few men who have the confidence  of both the business man and the  working man. Lundin lacks the confidence of the working people. Mayor  Brown has been a consistent friend of  the working people and has made a  success of his own business.

Asks Recognition of Yiddish  Bucharest (Jewish Telegraphic Ag-  gency)—"Universul"    reports    that  Rabbi Zirelson has submit led  to I.he  Minister of Education a memorandum   demanding   in   behalf   of   the  liessarabian Jews, the inclusion of  Hebrew or Yiddish as a. language of  instruction for Jews in public and  high schools. The memorandum further demands that the Talmud  Yishevas be. permitted to continue as  schools recognized by the Government. Another request is that instruction in Jewish schools be permitted on Sunday so that there  might be no need for a I tendance by  Jewish pupils in the Stale schools on  Saturdays and Jewish holidays. Still  another request is that Jewish religion and history be included in the  curricula of all public and high  schools. The teachers for these subjects would be chosen by the Kehillah  and would have an equal standing  with other secular teachers and would  be paid by the State or government.  The    memorandum    reproached   the  Government for not supporting Jewish schools up to now.  "Universul", the organ of the War  Minister, makes a strong anti-Semitic attack against, Zirclson's demands, declaring them to be absurd  and dangerous in view of Bessarabia's  geographic  position.

RESORTS   TO   ANTI-SEMITISM  Warsaw, February 1!) (Jewish Telegraphic Agency) — Premier Witos,  leader of the Peasant Party, which  until recently was most popular  with the Polish peasants, has now  resorted to ant i-Seinil.isni in a, last  attempt to regain his waning prestige.  The Feasant Party, which had 65  deputies in Hie Sejm, lost, considerable prestige by joining the forces of  the. Right parlies. Two factions of  I lie Peasant Sejm Club have split off,  leaving only 40 deputies of the original 05. The Wilos party is losing  many followers to Thugut's Radical  Party and   the Witos organization,  anxious to restore itself to its earlier  popularity, has resorted to the old  means of anti-Semitic, propaganda.  The official organ of the Peasant  Party is filled with such propaganda  and reoently warned (he Government   thai,   it   must   not   coin   gold  i &gt;y because Jews would export, if  abroad.

To the Jewish People of the Pacific Northwest:  BT NUMEROUS times during flic last ten years it has been  • suggested to me that the publication of a Jewish weekly  newspaper was a public necessity and that as an American  Citizen and a Jew it was my duty to assist in founding such an  enterprise. At first, I absolutely opposed the idea as I did not  believe that sectarian as well as racial differences should be kept  alive and 1 then sincerely believed that a newspaper or magazine  representing and expounding a particular creed or race would tend  to exaggerate those differences and would not be helpful to either  the spread of Americanism or to keep alive the proper spirit of  J udaism.  During the last ten years, however, conditions have changed.  Then the Jew was being encouraged in his effort to become thoroughly Americanized. Today much is being done to discourage him.  There has been formed the Ku Klux Klan, an organization based on  the most bigoted, narrow and unamerican principles, whose efforts  seem to be to make America not the land of liberty and equality  where all races and creeds may dwell in harmony and peace and  whose government shall be, as the immortal Lincoln said: "a  government of the people, by the people and for the people," but  a land governed by the few belonging to certain creeds and a land  wherein the Jew and the Catholic,—no matter what the land of  his nativity or what his record for patriotism and Americanism  may be—shall be an outcast and a stranger.  It is this condition that confronts Jewry of today that lias  convinced me that the Jew must organize not for aggression but  for self-protection. In order to make this organization effective,  he must have a means of inter-communication. That means is a  newspaper representing his ideas, his ideals, his aspirations and  his principles.  It is this that has convinced me that what ten years ago may  have been inadvisable has now become a duty to America and to  my Jewish brethren and it is to carry out these ideas that the  Jewish Transcript of the Pacific Northwest has been founded and  will be devoted.  There are at present between fifteen thousand and twenty  thousand Jews in the State of Washington. (No accurate census  has ever been taken). About two-thirds of these reside in the  three great cities of Seattle, Spokane and Tacoma. In addition  to this there are several thousand Jews in Idaho, British Columbia  and Alaska but there is not a Jewish newspaper published in the  Northwest, except one in the State of Oregon.  The Jewish Transcript finds in the foregoing facts a sufficient  warrant for its existence and it is my belief that the interests of  the Jewish people of the Pacific Northwest can best be furthered  by the publication of a live and up-to-date weekly newspaper  whose mission will be to advocate the highest ideals of Judaism,  linked with the most strenuous Americanism.  The Jewish Transcript will be a newspaper in the broadest  sense of the word. Its columns will be open to every Jewish organization and individual.    It will not in its editorial columns advocate  or support factionalism of any kind.    It will espouse the Jewish  cause fairly, judiciously and fearlessly.  It shall be the aim of The Jewish Transcript to inculcate and  develop in the younger generation an ardent interest in Judaism,  Jewish history and modern Jewish problems. Clubs and societies  devoted to furthering the cause of Judaism will be encouraged in  their programs by having their activities adequately and accurately  reported in the news columns of the paper.  The Jewish Transcript will contain an account of the social  events in the Jewish communities of the Pacific Northwest. It  will  contain   accounts  of  Congregational   and  Temple   activities.  In addition to "covering" news of purely local interest, The  Jewish Transcript will present, to its readers news of national and  worldwide Jewish interest gathered by the Jewish Telegraph  Agency, the foremost service of its kind in the world. This service  is being secured at considerable expense but in the belief that we  will be amply compensated by the enhanced value of the paper to  its readers.  Contributed articles on important Jewish problems of the day by  the spiritual leaders of the northwestern communities as well as  by men of national importance—both Jew and Gentile—will  appear regularly.  The Jewish Transcript will contain reviews of books and  magazine articles dealing with Jewish problems, critical reviews on  music, drama and art, poetry and fiction of Jewish interest.  The success of The Jewish Transcript or any similar publication  depends upon the Jewish people whom it hopes to serve. The  financial investment involved is extremely heavy and cannot long  be carried without the wholehearted cooperation of the Jewish  people.  Firstly, it is essential that the Jewish Transcript shall circulate  into the homes of every Jewish family in this section of the country.  Secondly, it is necessary that the readers scrutinize the advertising  columns and patronize the advertisers. For advertising is the  life blood of a newspaper.  Thus, The Jewish Transcript is launched. Whether it will  continue its mission of espousing the Jewish cause is left to the  Jewish communities of the Pacific Northwest to decide. There is  this to say, however, that as long as the Jewish people feel the need  of this paper and lend their support to it, the Jewish Transcript  will appear at a regular, stated time each week without fail. Should  that needed support not be. forthcoming, I will not attempt to  drag the publication along trusting to luck and hoping for better  times. There will be no intermediate path. Either the Jewish  Transcript will appear regularly or it will not appear at all.  I will appreciate hearing from every individual and organization  interested in submitting suggestions, ideas or criticisms.  Sincerely yours,  Herman Horowitz, Publisher.  553545  ^§							2015-11-08	2015-11-08	http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p16118coll10/id/4	4	5.jpg	/p16118coll10/image/5.jpg

BROADCASTING JUDAISM  It was from the heights of Mount Sinai that  Judaism was first broadcast to the world; and today  it is again being sent into the firnament from the more  prosaic heights of a New York skyscraper. From atop  the building of the American and Telegraph Company,  in the heart of New York, there are periodically being  transmitted to millions of radio listeners the facts of  Israel's faith, its history and its artistry. The sending  agency is known on radio charts as WEAF, the name  of the most powerful broadcasting station on earth.  Juadism in America, as many other religions, has  in the past decades suffered some diminution of its  influence. Its leaders were reliant on the presumably  never-failing impetus of its sacred writings and  glorious history.  Yet, as Dr. Cyrus Adler, the originator of the  Jewish broadcasting idea pointed out less than a year  ago, hardly an effort was made to employ the great  modern discoveries of science in the interest of the  faith. The phonograph, which could have been an  adjunct to Jewish education, as it is in the story-telling  education of the very young, was never though of in  that endeavor. Only of late years has even the  motion picture been considered in the light of its  Judaic educational value. And therefore, Dr. Adler,  who as president of the Dropsie College for Hebrew  and Cognate Learning, and acting president of the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America is particularly fitted to judge the needs of American Jewry, at  once seized upon the development of the radio as a  certain power in the hands of American Jewish  leadership.  The investigation of the possibilities for broadcasting religion led ultimately to the present arrangement with WEAF, The early programs, though considered experimental, proved extraordinarily succes-  ful. From the mail received by the station an appreciable number of commendatory letters were forwarded  to the office of the United Synagogue. With such  immediate encouragement, the committee on radio  programs was emboldened to institute several developments of Dr. Adler's original idea.  The Wednesday evening programs have become  a permanent and much lauded feature of the WEAF  schedule. Every week, at seven of that evening,  thousands of radio sets, owned by Jew and non-Jew  both, tune in to gather Judaism from the atmosphere.  Following the example of the senior organization the  Women's League of the United Synagogue has now  permanently adopted the air rights of WEAF for the  half hour beginning at five o'clock Mondays. The  Philadelphia branch impressed with the efforts of the  national officials, has arranged a monthly broadcasting program from WIP; and as is altogether proper,  to Dr. Adler was accorded the delivery of the first  address from this station on February 29th. So far,  in truth, has the original idea and example spread,  that radio programs under United Synagogue auspices  have been scheduled for many of the country's  larger cities, including, Providence, Washington,  Chicago, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Portland and San Francisco. Here is a great oak that  took no century to reach maturity.  It should not be though that the present programs  are to partake of the nature of the regular synagogue  service. All Judaism is not comprised in a hymn and  a sermon? Though the religious aspect will remain  predominant, entertainment—which is the first aim  of the radio—and instruction—which need never be  dull—are part of the broadcasting prospectus. Nothing associated with the thought of Judaism, whether  secular or religious, will be beyond the scope of the  United Synagogue plan.  Let the reader attempt to answer the apparently  simple query—"What is the Bible?" He will obtain  a concise and unmistakable definition from one of the  United Synagogue programs. "What is the Apocrypha?" "Are the Pharisees that which they have  been pictured?" "Who was Zcrubabbel?" "Were  the Minor Prophets really minor?" Can one not  uncover a host of questions to be explained from the  ready sonority of a loud speaker?  No racial group developes more news of import  during any period—in consideration of its comparative size—than does the people of Israel. Dispersed,  suffering, the universal scapegoat, yet the eternal  leader of thought and artistic progress—what happens  NEW YORK LETTER  The "Homier Rav" Arrives.  Pessimistic View of Jewish Future in Russia.  By D. Leonard Cohen  New York, accustomed as it is to distinguished  visitors who arrive in the city with each ship that  brushes past the Statue of Liberty on its way to  quarantine, paid more than passing notice to the  coming to America a few days ago of Rabbi Raphael  Mordecai Barishansky, the martyr rabbi, the famous  Russian Jewish cleric who dared to defy the late  Premier Lenin's Soviet Government, the pious, intrepid, rotund little man who dared to tell a Soviet  tribunal of "justice" that Jewishness and the Jewish  soul would outlive Sovietism as it has outlived other  governments down through the ages, and went to  jail for it.  The "Homier Rav"—he hails from Homel which  appertains to Chernigov Gubernia—has come to  America to stay and to spend his remaining years in  diligent effort to raise the standard of Jewishness in  America, just as he strove so valiantly to maintain  it in Russia under both Czarist and Soviet regimes.  Rabbi Barishansky's story is a most interesting  one, a story fraught with a true heroism and a self  effacement that amounts to martyrdom. It is not  the story of a fanatically religious old Jew, but rather the story of an intensely Jewish patriot, who was  willing to risk his mortal presence on this sphere to  save his people from extinction and complete absorption in a land, which though never tolerant of  the Jew, was nevertheless a stronghold of ancient  Jewish tradition and learning, a land where the Jew  demonstrated to the world his perseverence against  perversity and endless persecutions, a land where  Jews paid for their Jewishness in bloody pogroms  and tortures which were no less terrible than the  horrors of the fifteenth century Inquisitions.  Stop Jewish Teaching  The Soviet Government two years or more ago  ordered that the teaching of Hebrew to Jewish  children be stopped. It was ordered that the Hebrew language mus.t no longer be used, for the reason that Hebrew—at least this was their contention  —is Zionist propaganda and that Bolshevism, which  admits only of internationalism, could not permit a  nationalistic ideal such as Zionism to be promoted  within its boundaries.  Rabbi Barishansky not only refused to abide by  the Soviet dictum but even militated against it  openly. The famous rabbi, whose voice had long  been a power in Russia, at least among Jews, persisted in the use of the mother-tongue, taught it and  incited others to follow in the trail which he so gloriously blazed. A little more than a year ago he was  arrested and tried for his persistence in refusing to  obey the pronunciamento of the powers that be.  The Soviet tribunal of "justice" were gracious enough  to allow him fifteen minutes to speak in his own defence. The "Homier Rav" used the time allotted  him for his own defence to denounce Sovietism and  all of its institutions, delivering a scathing arraign  ment of the tyrannical, soul-devouring measures of  the Internationale. When his time was up he was  told: "You have finished", and the incorrigible little  rabbi retaliated with what has become a byword in  those homes where the Jewish soul tragically persists: "It is not I and Jewishness which have finished; it is you. The Jew and his Jewishness will outlive even your government, as it has outlived all  governments down through the ages." He was sentenced  to two years  in  prison.  After several fruitless appeals, sufficient influ-  ence was brought to bear with the result that lie  was released after seven months behind Soviet prison  walls. He went to Moscow and obtained citizenship there, with a view toward leaving Russia at  the first opportunity. His numerous requests for a  visa were repeatedly refused; the Soviet government was fearful of what he might have to say of  its institutions once he reached the outside world.  After six months he was successful, however, ami his  arrival in New York this week followed as a matter  of course.  Forbidding Picture  Rabbi Barishansky refuses to be stilled and the  picture of the Jewish future in Russia which he presents is indeed a forbidding one. The Soviet government says Rabbi Barishansky, has been so successful in its propaganda against Jewish institutions  that hardly more than a fragment remains. The  spirit of the Jew has been broken. At least this is  true of the young Jew; the old Jews, accustomed  after long years of devotion to their ideals, persist  hardily. The methods of the Soviet have removed  from the thoughts of the younger Jews and more especially among the Jewish children, any desire for  Jewish knowledge, and all inclination for the pursuit of Jewish learning after the traditional manner  of their fathers and grandfathers, and their progenitors for thousands of years into antiquity.  Jewish customs, Jewish mannerisms, Jewish ideals  have been held up to scorn and the Jewish child in  the street is among the first to tag after the aged  Jew who dares to venture into any thoroughfare  where they might be congregated. Everything that  is traditionally Jewish is caricatured as despicable  and contemptible, says the rabbi. Observance of  the Sabbath has been forbidden as has the observance of all other Jewish holidays. The Jewish home  life, long the cornerstone of all that is Jewish, has  been broken up; the spirit of the Jew is being smothered by a government which admits of no faiths, no  God, declares Rabbi Barishansky.  Tyrannical as was the Czarist government, it was  more to be preferred than is Sovietism, says Rabbi  Barishansky, who himself is liberal in his politics.  "Any government would be better than Sovietism,"  he says in his sibilant Yiddish, "any government  would be more tolerant; even I do not wish a return  to the Czars", and his eyes twinkled ever so slightly,  shedding more light on the kindliness of his soul  which has become so embittered through the injustices which have been heaped upon his people, and  which must surely be in a measure responsible for  his pessimistic view of the situation.  For those who are not inclined to accept Rabbi  Barishansky's condemnation of the Soviet Government, his personality is such as to warrant more  than a mild interest in his remarks.  to this people happens to the world. News of the  current events of Jewish life, always of general import,  can now be radiated through the air. To this end the  cooperation of the Jewish Telegraph Agency is  proving invaluable.  Music, the harmony of sound, is by its nature the  most useful and worthy of radio employments.  Hence, folks of religious music or other compositions  of Jewish origin, take a great place in all United  Synagogue programs. Besides a number of America's  finest cantours, the artists here enumerated comprise  in part the distinguished coadjutors in the organization's presentations. There are Josef Rosenblatt, best  known of synagogue singers, Mischa Mischakoff,  violinist, Harry Kaufman, piano accompanist, Dorothy Gordon, soprano, Mrs. Sigmund Adler, the first  English Butterfly at the Metropolitan Opera House  and Rozsi Varady, whose 'cello charmed the late  President Harding in a White House recital early  in 1922.  With all of this, there still remained a limited  field wherein the shortness of the programs did not  permit the radio committee to operate. The Jewish  woman in particlar the Jewish mother, sought assistance in her own unique problems. The Wednesday  programs might tell of the holidays in their major  aspects but women are interested in the observance  of holidays in the home, where children receive the  best of their training. Lessons in Judaism and child  culture can, if so arranged be directed to mothers  alone. A catalogue of those broadcasting on Monday  afternoons for the Women's League makes noteworthy  reading—it includes the names of Mrs. Charles 1.  Hoffman, president of the Women's League, Prof.  Patty Hill of Teachers' College, Columbia University,  Mrs. Samuel Spiegel, chairman of the New York  Branch, Mrs. Israel Davidson, Miss Rebekah Natel-  son (in an Hadassah program on women's work in  Palestine), Mrs. Sada Cowen, Willy Pogany, and Mrs.  Nathan Seidman.

The education of the recalcitrant Jew has  for long been a major problem in Judaism; and now  the man who has for years not entered a synagogue or  associated with his kind finds a new and facile memory  in the comfortable strains of the radio. The rabbi  or teacher cannot invade his home to urge him to a  closer rapport with his faith or with his people; but  no wail is thick enough to be impervious to the  radiation of electric waves.  —Abraham Burstein in The Jewish Daily News.

The Ku Klux Klan movement, or  the "K. K. K.'s", as they arc called,  is a revival of an organization which  was very strong in the south during  the reconstruction period following  the Civil War. The organization  started in Tennessee about 18G0,  and soon spread throughout the  southern States. Its activities were  directed primarily against negroes,  and by a system of terrorism, such  as whippings, tarring and feathering,  and even murder and arson, attempted to prevent five million negroes,  just freed from bondage, from exercising rights granted them by the  14th and 15th Amendments to the  Constitution of the United States.  The lawlessness of the Ku Klux  Klan was responsible for the establishment of military government in  most of the southern states, and in  1871 an Act of Congress was passed,  known as tho "Force Bill", which,  by making most of the acts they  were guilty of committing, a felony,  resulted in the final disappearance of  the order.  The present Ku Klux Klan is organized entirely along the lines of  the clans of the reconstruction period. It is intended, however, to be  national in its scope and is directed  against three classes, Catholics, Jews  and negroes. Who tho men are that  are connected with the Order, its  Constitution, form of organization,  its officers, will appear from time to  time in future issues. In the next  issue I will give the life history of  O. H. Carpenter, its Grand Dragon  for the State of Washington, whom I  have known personally for 35 years.  It will be for the readers to judge  whether he is a fool, a hypocrite or  a rascal.  SEATTLE JEWISH BOY  COMPOSES SONG HIT  APPOINTED TO COMMISSARY  Moscow, Feb. 23 (J.T.A.) Reuben  Levin was today appointed by tho  Soviet Government to be Deputy  Commissary of Finance. M. Levin is  a Jew as is Assistant Commissary of  Finance Vladimow who was recently  appointed.  What is said to be one of the peppiest jazz songs written in the past  year has just been published by a  young Seattle Jewish boy, Leo Weiss-  man, 20 years old. The song is  named: "Whisp'ring Nile" and has  been featured for the past few weeks  at all the local theatres and cabarets.  Young Weissman possesses unusual musical ability. He is considered  one of the finest violin players ever  produced in this section of the country.  While still attending Franklin high  sohool, young Weissman was employed by the school board to direct,  grammar   school   orchestras.    After  graduation, lie. spent one year in the  employment of the school board directing grammar and high school orchestras.  To Go To New York  Weissman plans to go to New York  in a short time to take lessons fr   Leopold Auer, world famous violin  teacher, who developed JaSoha Hcif-  etz, Mischa Klnian and other famous  musicians.  The musical prodigy was born in  St. Louis, Missouri. He came to  this city with his parents fourteen  years ago. He is a graduate of Rainier .school and Franklin High Sohool,  Following are I lie words of Weiss-  man's fox trot ballad, "Whisp'ring  Nile":  Hear that haunting melody!  Through the night it calls to me,  Swaying palms, the moonlight glow,  The Nile, that's where 1 want, to go.  Just, an echo and it seems,  1 can see its silver beam,  All about there's mystery,  The Nile, a thousand memories.  Chorus:  Down by the Whisp'ring Nile,  That's where you danced for me,  There by the Whisp'ring Nile,  To  an   Egyptian  melody,  The  moonbeams   played   in   your  hair,  While sweet perfumes filled the air,  You won my heart with your smile,  Down by the Whisp'ring Nile.

Mr. Lundin's Statement  I am not a member of the Klu Klux  Klan and never will be. I am a firm  believer in the fundamental American  doctrine that all citizens arc entitled  to the same just and equal treatment  and consideration, regardless of race,  color or religious belief. Any attempt  to divide the American people along  racial, religious or color line, or to discriminate against any citizen ,on any  such ground, violates the principles on  which our government is founded. I  have no sympathy with any organization, whether secret or open, that encourages any of the un-American  ideas above referred to. I favor the  enforcement of law in all cases by the  public authorities chosen for that purpose, and am opposed to any and all  attempts by private individuals or  organizations to administer punishment of any real or fancied wrong. I  have never entertained any doubt that  open and public discussion and action  by the American people and their duly  chosen representatives and officials are  the means best adapted to preserve  order and private respect for law. I  would rather be defeated than to be  elected Mayor of Seattle with any  misunderstanding of my position on  these fundamental propositions.

'the question was heatedly argued  before Hie Hector of the University  who urged a settlement of the ipies-  h'.ln and made the statement that  Rabbis of America, England, Ger-  many,   Austria   and   France   are   un  opposed  corpses.  to   the  dissection   of  Jewish  Rabbi  projected  Condemns Law  Perlmutter   condemned   the  law compelling the delivery of Jewish corpses. He spoke for  two hours and with tears in his eyes  insisted that the law regarding Hie  Care of the Jewish deail is one of the  most holy in the entire Jewish Code,  a law which no rabbi has the right to  modify.  "The Jewish law", Rabbi Perlmutter expostulated, "reipiires thai  a dead body when it appears in the  next world and stands before the  Judgment of the Almighty, must, be  entire and unmutilated.   God made  man in  His own image.    II   is so thai.  He placed him on earth, and il is so  that he must return to Him."  Jewish students present, at Hie  conference insisted that the Jewish  law permits dissection and declared  that they will light the superstition  which prevents the delivery of corpses lo the University.  Jewish Students Expelled  The question of delivering Jewish  corpses to the lMedical College for  dissection arose several weeks ago  uh.n Christian students expelled  the Jewish students from classes demanding that they provide a pro  rata  number of corpses.    The nial lei  was temporarily adjusted a few days  ago, when Jewish students were permit led to return on condition that  they provide one Jewish corpse which  theJewish students would themselves  dissect, but   it   was further slipiilaled  that, Jewish students be segregated  from the Christian students in order  to prevent further disorder.

Heartiest  Congratulations  To  TheJewish Transcript  Kaplan Printing  Co.      110 Madison Street  VANDALS ATTEMPT TO  RUIN SARGENT PAINTING  Boston, February 23 (Jewish Telegraphic Agency) A vandalistic attempt was made lo ruin the Sargent  Synagogue painting at the Huston  Public Library. An acid liquid  which may be black ink has been  thrown on the pied lire and there are  at least a dozen black spots on Hie  picture. If is not known yet whether anything can be done lo restore  the painting.  This incident came just al the time  when there is renewed discussion regarding the removal of Hie picture,  which is held as insulting to Jews.  Two years ago, after an extended  controversy, the legislature passed  an aid, directing the State Department of Education lo lake the picture by right, of eminent domain for  use in the leaching of ail or for university extension work. Dr. l'ayson  Smith, Commissioner of Education,  recommended the repeal of the law-  ill his annual report this year stating thai il has been impossible to  use Hie painting for the purpose intended  by  the  Legislature.  At the hearing early in the week  former Hepresentativc Coleman E.  Silbert of Boston asked for a further  continuance as all parties interested  in the controversy were conferring  on a plan by which the Attorney  General would be asked to bring  action in the Supreme Courl which  if sustained by the court, would result, in the removal of the. painting  by  the   Library   trustees.     The  plan  is understood to be based on a contention that the Library trustees  have given a permanent lease of that  portion of the wall upon which I lie  painting hangs in a public building  to private parlies. As a result of  I he reported marring of I he painting  by vandals, the committee expects  that there w ill be a large attendance  al, the hearing next Wednesday in  the Slate  House.

Anti-Semitic forces  have won in practically every instance at the local parliament elec  lions and a great anti-Jewish campaign is looked for at Hie elections  lo the Reichstag.  The   anti-Semitic    People's    Parly  with twelve seats in the Mecklenburg Diet, have a majority of power,  having aligned with them the forces  of Hie Extreme Right. It is understood thai I he anti-Semitic leader of  the  People's  Party,   Deputy  (Irefem,  will become Hie Premier of Mecklenburg.   An overwhelming victory for  I he Right is also reported from 'I'llu-  ringia, where an anti-Semitic government is forming. Similar reports  are had from I he free eil ies of l.uelier  and Bremen.  The Nationalist Party in Hie  Reichstag  has  adopted   a   resolution  calling upon all Germany lo exclude  the. "alien-blooded Jews from the  political, cultural and economic life,  of the country.   Only blood-Germans  should rule the country and have  the right, to vole. Thus will we  abolish    the    Jewish    capitalist     and  Marxist domination."  At the election of the Landbund  in Brandenburg there was an anti-  Semitic demonstration of considerable proportions and the expulsions  of all  alien  elements was demanded.  MR.

The Young Men's Hebrew Association  Its Present And Future  By Dr. IIknuy II. Schwartz, President  This year marks the birth of a new  era in the. history of the Young  Men's Eebrew Association. A consolidation has taken place between  the Ancient Order of the Sphinx and  the Y. M. II. A., making available  splendid limber for an active organization. Consequently, a program  has been inaugurated that, will justify the existence of the association  and will make the organization a  thing of which  we can all be proud.  Between 1910, when the Y. M. II.  A. was founded, and 1918, the organization marched steadily forward.  Like any institution it had its setbacks, but, on the whole, its progress was very satisfactory.  Two years of comparative inertia  followed Hie war activities—due primarily to the readjustment and homecoming of our boys. Reconstruction of the entire economic situation  throughout the country affected our  community and therefore the Y. M.  11. A. Interest was centered elsewhere.  Another factor in causing a sagging of interest, was due to removal  of a great field of activity and mode  of service. With the end of the war  and curtailment of activities at Camp  Lewis the wonderful service to those  in training and engaged in the service was no longer needed. It left a  gap in the Y program.  Y Goes Forward  The period of reconstruction is  practically over.    This year the Y.

In this department is included social,  gymnasium and sport activities and  the Boy Scout work.  Secondly, tho Y. M. H. A. is con-  ducting an educational campaign.  Citizenship classes will be begun  shortly to train prospective American citizens in the history of our  country and in civics. As part of  the educational program, the association plans to hold a series of meetings at which prominent citizens of  the northwest will be invited to  speak.  Social Welfare  Thirdly, the Y. M. H. A. is deeply  interested in tho social welfare of  its members. An Employment Committee has been formed which is  functioning splendidly in securing  positions for Jewish men out of work.  For Jewish men who come here from  out-of-town, the Y is always open  and a special Housing Committee is  always on the job to secure these  men homes with local Jewish families.  There is under investigation at  present, the advisability of establishing a free, medical and dental clinic  at the Y auditorium.  These activities are but a few of  (hose now contemplated by the organization. The Y. M. H. A. is an  integral part of the Jewish community and needs the support of not, only  its own members but the cooperation of the entire community to successfully carry out its program.  Y.M.H.A.

Litchman Speaks on  American Presidents  "Washington and Lincoln represent, the greatest, principle in human  affairs," declared Mr. Mark Litchman in a eulogistic address on Amer  lea's greatest men delivered at the  meeting of Seattle Lodge last, Wednesday night at the Elks Club.  "Thai principle is Emancipation,"  he said. "Washington liberated a  people from the economic servitude  of England and Lincoln emancipated  a human race, from the servitude of  t he Soul hern slave holders.  Slavery Today  "The principle of Emancipation  that they Stood for is ever present in  the human breast. We have today a  form of slavery far more, inimical  than existed in the time, of Washington and Lincoln.  "It is more dangerous because, it,  is more subtle. It is a mental slavery to racial intolerance, religious  bigotry and national hatred. We  must emancipate ourselves from  these three, evils. This can be done  only by Education."  NO ANTI-SEMITISM IN RUSSIA  An interesting picture of Jewish  life in Soviet, Russia was painted by  Dr. Anna Louise Strong, noted journalist and educator, who has just  returned from Russia, at the meeting  of Seattle Lodge on February 13.

The  University of Cracaw has 5,250 students of whom 1,000 are Jews; Lem-  berg has 0,010 students of whom  2,643 are Jews; Warsaw has 8,842 of  whom 2,807 are Jews; Posen has  3,313 students of whom 22 are Jews.  It is interesting to note, that the  Jewish population in Poland is 15%  of the whole and if the Humerus  elausus were to be. invoked the number of Jewish students in the universities would be decreased to 10%  of the whole instead of 24% as at  present.

The Jew has much to  be proud of in this world because the  touch  of   his  civilization   has  ever  been a help to the human race,  battling for human righls in religious and political liberty.  In morals the Jewish people are  the equal of any oilier race upon the  earth—in thrift they are unsurpassed  —in service to the religious world  they are unequalled. In philosophy,  science and ail, they have contributed their full share to this world.  They are loyal lo their code and  standards and  to their people.  While other races have been assimilated and their character dissipated  and gone into history, the Jew  through Ihe thousands of years Ihal  the race has been upon the earth,  still holds to his racial characteristics with a determination that convinces us will carry on through Ihe  coining ages.  I know dial The Jewish Transcript has mapped out a program of  service to the Jewish people of Seattle. 1 feel confident thai your  paper will help to break down Ihe  barriers of prejudice between Jew  and non-Jew. I wish you success on  your worthwhile endeavor.  Sincerely yours,  Mayor Edwin J. Brown.

ZIONIST ACTIVITIES  \ chapter of I he Zionist Organization of America was established in  Seat I le many lyears ago. So many  changes have taken  place since then  in the organizat ion itself that an adequate history of the movement in  Seattle cannot be given.  Shortly after the Balfour declaration was issued in l!)17, a reorganization look place in the local chapter.  Mr. Harris Waxmaii was elected  President,, and il was due almost entirely to his unceasing and indefatigable efforts that members increased,  meet ings were held regularly, and the  organization placed on a sound fooling. It was Mr. Waxman, loo, who  drew    about   him   a   coterie   of   the  younger men, who have aided and  supported the movement  in Seattle.  ever since. Among I hose deserving  particular mention are Messrs. Max  A. Silver, Sam Cohen and Mandel  Siegel.      Messrs.    Louis    l{ iilienst.ein,  J. Erickson, and Maurice Gerber are  equally intensely interested with Mr.  Waxman, and have been a powerful  force in  I he movement,.  Another man who deserves especial  mention is Mr. Herman Shocken,  who will be long remembered in Seal He for the splendid work he did in  Ihe interests of Ihe war orphans, and  I he pari he played in prael ieally every communal enterprise in Seattle,  after ihe Armistice, and for a year  or i wo later.  By Eimon Weinie  While the membership of the organization is but little more than  one hundred at the present, time,  nevertheless very effective work has  been done. 11 was almost, entirely  due tO I he efforts of the small group  of Zionists thai, Karen llaycsod was  enabled to raise more than $25,000.00  in Seal He. Of course, thai money  could never have been raised if if  had not been for the visit of the  Skolow delegation, lull. Ihe untiring  energy of Ihe local leaders resulted  in collecting the money and sending  il I,i Palestine.  The ollicers for the present year are:  Harris Waxman, Honorary Chairman; Eimon L. Wienir, Chairman,  Max A. Silver, Vice-Chairman, Louis  Rubenstein, Treasurer, M. D. tfyce,  Secretary.  If  is  needless,  of  course,  to  point,  out the objeots of the Zionist organization, for these ought, to be well  known In every Jew. In brief, however, ihe purpose of our organization is Id enlighten Jewry as to the  need of rehabilitating Palestine, gathering data and informal ion concerning Ihe progress being made in that,  e dry, and spreading that informal ion among as many Jews as possible. Its purpose is also, of course,  lo assist, in every way possible in  raising adequate funds for  Ihe needs  in Palestine.  ZIONISTS IN CONFERENCE DISCUSS POLITICAL ZIONISM  MR.

A.)-  The census of 1890 as a basis for  computation of immigration quotas was definitely rejected by the Senate  Immigration Committee which opened ils hearing on the proposed change!  in  the  present  immigration  law Thursday.     A   lighl  to  retain  the  present  provision for quotas of three percent, was lost, however, and the amend-  menl lo the pending immigration bill will provide for two percent, quotas  based on  Ihe census of 1910.  The vote on the census basis was seven for 1910 and four against, being  divided as follows: For:—&lt; lhairman (loll, Senators &lt; lopeland of New 5 orki  Sterling of Sout h I lakota, Johnson of ('alifornia, Key68 of New Hampshire,  Willis of Ohio and King of blah. Against: Heed of Pennsylvania, Harris  of Georgia,  Harrison of Mississippi and Shield of Tennessee.  A closer vole was had on Ihe percentage provision, Colt, Copeland,  Sterling, Johnson and King losing a hard fought bailie to Willis, who mho  diieed the motion for two percent, quotas, rallying Harris, Harrison, Shields  and  Reed lo his support.  No decision was reached regarding the exemption of relatives from the  quota, Ibis and Ihe remaining features of Hie bill being referred to a sub-  COmmittee, which includes beside Senator Heed as Chairman, King, Cope-  land and ('oil. This committee will begin ils wink at once. A general  hearing on the bill will be held Saturday, March S, at 10:30 o'clock. Thus  far the committee lias received no requests from Jews to appear at the hearing either as  individuals or  representatives of organizations.  Prior lo Ihe defeat of Senator Harrison's motion to fix the quotas by  Ihe  1890 census and carrying of Senator  King's motion  to adopt, the  LOlfl  ligures, ihe committee voted on a scries of motions, each intended to amend  Ihe immigration measure. Senator Harris proposed that the bill provid'1  ihal immigration be BUSpended for live years. This was lost, two to eighl  with   Harris and Harrison  Ihe only supporters.  A  tion by Senator Heel to make the quota basis 1 percent, of the  census ligures of Itlltl plus I percent, of the nationals of any one counlry  shown by the census of 1920 who have completed more than 50 percent of  the steps necessary to naturalization, was lost, I to 7. Those wdio votoil  for  this motion  were  Reed,  Harris,  Harrison and Shields.  Then Senator Harrison offered an amendment lo the Reed motion which  would   make  the addili il admission  2  percent,   instead  of   1   percent,   of  semi-naturalized citizens shown by ihe census of 1920. This, too, was losffl  I to 7.  In well informed circles in Washington it was staled thai it is practically certain thai, the Bouse of Representatives will compromise by alsG  adopting Ihe census of 191(1 as a basis for fixing quotas and that, the twO  branches of Congress will ultimately unite on this. This prediction warn eii a i Mil ional  weight by a si a I emeu I   made by Senator Colt in which W  told of a recent conversation with Chairman Johnson of ihe House Immi'  gration C niitfee and  the author of Ihe Johnson  Immigration Bill,   wW  said thai his committee's decision iii favor of the 1890 provision was fakef  with "great regret". Senator Coll, intimated that he had received Ihe im  pression  thai  Congressman Johnson would be ready  lo compromise.

CHALLENGES BLOOMFIELD  London (J. T. A.)—Ted (Kid)  Lewis, former welterweight champion of Ihe world, having held the  title fro,n Mild I,, 1922, has challenged Jack Bloomfield lo a bailie for  Ihe light-heavyweight championship  of England, a title which Bloomfield  has held since 1922. The proposed  bailie holds special interest because  of Lewis's al si legendary disinclination lo lighl a fellow Jew. lie  has    always    avoided     lislie    bailies  with members of his own race but  when such matches have been unavoidable, Lewis confined himself to  boxing, averting the possibility' of  inflicting any physical injury. Lewis   declares   that   Ihe   lighl    will    be  more Interesting than a Bloomfield-  Carpentier   battle.     "If   Bloomfield  Wants action", lie declares, "I'll  give him all he's looking for."  NAME  STREET AFTER WILSON  Warsaw   (J.   T.   A.)

T.

The Pope, ('ardinal Bourne stated,  agreed lo the British Mandate over  Palestine believing that Britain will  carry out that Mandate with fairness  lo all elements in Palestine and thai  he regards the situation in Palestine  as greatly improved since 1919. The  I'ardinal expressed Ihe belief that  an Arab-Jew agreement on the basis  of I he Mandate and I he right of Ihe  Jews I,i establish a National Home  in Palestine is quite possible If everyone concerned will be reasonable  and   if   the   extreme   Zionists   do   not  obtain dominance.  Cardinal Bourne denied Ihe resignation of Barlassina, Catholic prelate iii Palest ine, who il. was reported would be recalled in I he spring at  the insistence of native Catholics  who are desirous of having the Pope  replace Barlassina with a native prelate.  175 Children Attend  Seattle Talmud Torah  By A. ROSENTHAL  The   perpetuation  of  Judaism   and  (he continuance of the religious life  of a Jewish community is wholly dependent upon the existence, proper  maintenance ami successful management of a Communal Hebrew School,  known as "Talmud Torah", where  children are admitted and taught lo  read, write and understand Ihe lie-  brew language and receive biblical  insi ruction.  The Seattle Talmud Torah does  all I his. About 175 children, ranging  from the ages of 5 lo II years, receive daily instruction from a staff  of trained and competent lea,-hers,  supervised by a Board of Education  and   ihe  superintendence  of   Rabbi  Simon Winograil, of the Bikur Chol-  iiin synagogue.  Instruction Hours  The hours of instruction are from  3:30 to 8:30 P. M. daily, anil from !)  to 12 noon Sundays. The teachers  receive salaries ranging from a minimum  of $1800.00  lo $2500.00 a  year.  The monthly budget is $850.00,  which is derived from voluntary contributions and monthly dues from a  present membership of about 225.  The Talmud Torah owns its ground  and   the   two  buildings   thereon  free  from  incumbrance,  situated on  Ihe  southeast coiner of 17th avenue and  East Alder street. One building  consists of four large and well-vcnlil-  aled class rooms and Ihe other building is the assembly hall. There is a  large playground which Ihe children  use during recess hour.  While  Ihe Talmud  Torah  has ex  isted for many years, a reorganization of its administration and change  of policy has taken place about three  years ago which has proven very successful.  The Officers  The present officers of Hie institutions are: Julius Cohen, president;  A. Aronin, vice president; Jos. Hurwitz, treasurer; A. Rosenthal, secretary; Board of Directors—Abe  Spring,    II.    Waxninn,    N.    Anehes,  Chas.   Aronson,   M.   Hurwitz,   and  Louis Pearl, (one year term) M.  Ilimelhoch, D. J. Ricklcs, M. Gen-  auer, I). Grinslein, Sam Lawson and  C. Miller (two year term), Jake  Hurwitz, Abe Nelson, Sol. Rogers,  II. Woren, Dave Pass and S. Kol-  atch (three year term). Board of  Education: M. Aronin, chairman; M.  (e nauer, Sam Lawson, Abe Nelson,  Jake  1 lurw ilz and  II. Woren.  The last fiscal year showed an income of $10,500.29 ami an expense of  $11,800.00, which deficit is expected  to be made up by an increase of membership the present year.  To Appear at Lodge  I ii ihe \ ery near future, the members of Seattle Lodge 1. (). B. B. at  one of its "Educational" meetings,  will get an excellent opportunity to  listen to Ihe school exercises of the  children of the Talmud Torah, and  will then be able to judge for themselves, whether ibis institution is  mil deserving of the full support of  Ihe entire Jewish Community of Seattle.

The  charges were made by Dear Ilayoin,  Ihe Hebrew newspaper published in  Palestine, causing a sensation.

Events have been going  forward with a swiftness that fairly takes the breath  away by comparison, at least, with the weeks of  "watchful waiting", which have preceded for so  many months past. After days of incomplete and  unsatisfactory as well as incomplete reports of the  conference of King Hussein of Hedjas with the Arab  notables from the many Arab domains, who have  gathered at Amman in Transjordania to discuss the  proposed Anglo-Arab treaty and the projected Pan-  Arabic Confederation, there comes at last news to  the effect that the Jews and Arabs have finally arrived at what might be at least the basis for a mutual  understanding. There is even talk that an Arab-  Jewish Entente Cordiale is pending.  During the last week in January a Jewish delegation proceeded to Ammah, following an invitation received by wireless from Hussein, which came  after it had already been decided not to send a delegation to confer with the Hedjas king. The delegation was royally received. The very air seemed  charged with a spirit of friendliness and when the  Jewish delegation offered a moderate interpretation  of the Balfour Declaration, they "met with understanding." The cabled dispatch which told of the  conference was couched in most careful and studied  terms, telling not too much but permitting of imaginative speculation. The despatch did state definitely, however, that the moderate interpretation of  the Balfour Declaration met with favor; that Hussein and his son, the Emir Abdullah, ruler of Transjordania, stipulated that the rights of Arabs must  be observed, and that both Hussein and Abdullah  were anxious for the cooperation of World Jewry in  the solution of general Arab problems, concluding  with a quotation from the address of the Jewish  delegation to Hussein, emphasizing the friendliness  of the Jews toward the Arabs and their desire to live  in peace alongside them, not neglecting to remind  the Arab chieftain of the traditional Jewish right to  a Homeland in Palestine and the approval by nations of the world of the Balfour Declaration and  the British Mandate.  It does not seem too imaginative to offer the  suggestion that there is in all this the beginnings of  a peace between the Arabs and Jews, which has not  hitherto been known, that there shortly will be established an Entente Cordiale between the Arabs  and the Jews.—D.

So, as the  winter slowly merges into spring, there is brought  back to the memory of the Jew the time-honored  story of Purim, cherished by him not only for its  significance of the past, but also for its relation to  the present.  Purim, which is decidedly a national and not a  religious holiday, as is indicated by the fact that it  permits of all temporal pursuits, is celebrated in  commemoration of the deliverance of the Persian  Jews from a plot to exterminate them. As the story  goes, the Jews were exiled from their native land  and driven into Persia some half century before  Christ. There they lived distributed among the numerous provinces of the kingdom, in an orderly and  peaceable manner, unbroken by the occurrence of  any unusual event, until the reign of King Ahasu-  crus.  Shortly after this monarch succeeded to the  throne he deposed his queen Vashti and selected  Esther, a Jewish maiden of rare beauty, as her successor. Before she was made queen, Esther had  been the ward of her cousin Mordecai during the  period subsequent to the death of her parents, and  when she was taken to the palace he visited it daily  to make inquiries after her welfare.  On one of these occasions he encountered Hainan  the Aggegite, a Persian nobleman who had recently  been appointed by the King as his grand-vizier, to  whom he refused to prostrate himself or to do obes-  iancc. Hainan, whose instinctive pride was greatly  touched by the refusal of Mordecai to do him homage, determined not only to avenge himself against  Mordecai, but against all the Jews of the realm.  In pursuance of this object, he went to the King  and charged the Jews with being a disloyal people,  decidedly inimical to the best interests of the kingdom. Upon these grounds he prevailed upon Ahasu-  erus, naturally a weak and subservient ruler, to  issue a proclamation ordering a general extermination of all the Jews of the realm, and a confiscation  of their property. The proclamation was accordingly issued and a day appointed upon which the  Jews were to be exterminated. In anticipation of  that time, Haman built a gibbet upon which he intended to hang Mordecai.  This decree provoked great fear on the part of  the Jews, and they declared a general fast for three  days and clothed themselves in sackcloth. Esther,  at a great personal risk, went to the King and entreated him in behalf of her people to rescind the  decree. The King was charmed by her beauty and  promised to dine with her in her own apartment on  two successive nights. On the night before the second banquet, when Esther intended to make her  petition, the King was sleepless, and commanded  that the national records be read to him. The records disclosed the fact that Mordecai had discovered a plot devised by two of the King's servants  against his life and had revealed it to Esther. For  this, by some oversight, Mordecai had received no  reward.  In the meantime Haman had come to the King  to ask permission to execute Mordecai at once.  The King asked him, "What shall be done to the  man whom the King desires to honor?" Haman,  thinking that Ahasuerus alluded to him, suggested a  magnificent pageant at which one of the nobles  should serve as attendant, The King immediately  adopted the suggestion and ordered Haman to lead  Mordecai, for whose execution he had already completed arrangements, in honor and glory through the  streets of the capitol.  The next day, at the banquet to which Haman  had also been invited, Esther presented her petition.  The King granted it at once and ordered that the  old edict be revoked and a new one issued granting  the Jews power to avenge themselves upon their  enemies.    By the King's order also Haman and his  COMING EVENTS  Wednesday, March 12.  Seattle Lodge, I. 0.  B.  B.  Meeting at Scottish  Rite Temple.

Thus the  day that had been appointed for the extermination  of the Jews was transformed into one of rejoicing  for all the Jews of the realm and has gone down  throughout the ages as a national holiday observed  by all Jews in all lands.  The significance of Purim lies not only in its  historical importance, but also in the fact that it  throws a ray of light upon the peculiar individuality  of the Jew. The temperament of the Jew is closely  interwoven with his past. The two thousand years  of persecution and of prosecution, of upheavals and  of irregularities, of trials and of tribulations, of  evictions and restitutions, have left their indelible  impress upon the personality of the Jew, and have  moulded him into an unique type.  Purim is particularly effective in disclosing the  character of the Jew, because it is so representative  of his past. Everything, both of the bright and  the cloudy aspects of Jewish history; of the normal  and abnormal conditions of Jewish life, are embodied in the story of Purim. And so that holiday, being symbolical of the Jews' past, is important in so  far as it makes possible the interpretation of the  Jew of today in the light of the Jew of yesterday.  MORRIS A. "ROBBINS.  THE PRESS AND IMMIGRATION  ©OTH the New York Times and the New York  Evenign Post have commented editorially on the  unfair discrimination of the Johnson Bill. Both urge  consideration of the view taken by Secretary of  State Huges.  "It is true," says the Times, "that the spokesmen  for certain races seek to prevent the passage of any  legislation restricting immigration. But the most  valid objections so far made have been against unfair  discrimination. The Johnson Bill unfortunately discriminates against Italians, Poles, Russians and Jews,  as well as against Japanese. The weakness of the  Johnson Bill which has many excellent provisions,  lies in the method by which it seeks to discriminate  against certain races. Why give needless affront to  the Japanese and to other groups of foreign citizens  in the country?"  The Post says in part: "Regarding the subject  of immigration restriction, there is room for argument.  Regarding the manner in which the Johnson Bill seeks  to exclude Japanese from the United States, there is  none. The Japanese are a proud people, who have  been raised within an amazingly short time to  the  position   of  a   world   power  That  we   should  make them feel we are discriminating against them—  as   we   should   if   the  Johnson   Bill   were   passed   as   J  drafted—might easily,  taken   with  other sources  of  \  friction, upset  the delicate balance.     I'Vom  this point  of   view   Secretary   Hughes'   criticism   carries   great  weight."  Rabbi Joseph Silberman, pleading for greater interest in Palestine, says valuable minerals and oil  have been discovered there. Standard Oil is now  prospecting near the Red Sea and in the Dead Sea  there is enough potash to supply the world for 400  years.    Copper and gold  have been found also.  That's news to arouse interest in any country.—  Arthur  Brisbane.

The objeel of this meeting is not  agitation;  il   is the statement   of a  plain    ease    in    such    terms   as    may  serve to arrest the attention of the  Nation with regard to a matter which  is of no mere local importance, which  does mil  merely affect Ihe rights and  ei sent ial privileges of our Jewish  fellow citizens as freemen and Americans, but which touches the dignity  of our Governmeni and the maintenance of those rights of manhood  which that (lovernment was set up  in vindicate.  The  facts  are   these:   for  some 80  years a treaty has exisled between  this counlry and Russia, iii which it.  is explicitly covenanted and agrei d  t hn I I he inhabitants of the two nations shell have ihe liberty of entering any pari of Ihe territory of either  thai   is open   to foreign  commerce;  that they shall he al liberty to sojourn and reside in all parts whatsoever of the territory thus opened to  commerce in order to a 11 end iii I heir  affairs, and Ihal. they shall enjoy  Ihe  same security and protection as inhabitants of  the oountry  in  which  they are sojourning, on condition, of  course, I ha i I hey submit to the laws  and ordinances there prevailing, and  particularly to the regulations there  iii force concerning commerce. For  some 40 years the obligations of this  treaty have been disregarded by  Elussia in respect of our Jewish fellow  citizens. Our Government has protested, but has never cone beyond  proiefa. After 40 years of correspondence the Russian Governmeni  naturally does not expect the matter  to be carried beyond protest to action, and so continues to act as il  pleases in this mat ler, in Ihe confidence thai our (lovernment dor, not  Beriouslj menu to include our Jewish fellow citizens among those upon  whose rights it   will  insist.  We   are   a   practical   people.     hike  the resl of the world, we establish  our trade relations upon grounds of  interest, and not sentiment, The  feeling of the American people toward the people of Russia has always been one of deep sympathy,  and I believe of ready comprehension, and we have deall with their  Governmeni in frankness and honor,  wherever il appears that the inter  e i ol hoi h nai ions could be served.  y\ •    hs\ e   not   held   off   from   cordial  intercourse or withheld our respect  because her polh ical  policy  v  sharply contrasted with ours. Our  desire is lo he her friend and lo make  our relal ions with her closer and  closer.  The American Principle  But i here lies a principle hack of  our life.   America is aol a mere body  of traders;  if is a   body of free men.  Our greatness is built upon our freedom is moral, not material.

Altogether,   171   loans   averaging  from   $25   to   $100   each,   have   been  made,   Secretary   Erdrioh's   figures  show.

Plans Aid  To Garden City  Finns to raise funds in Seattle for  the B'nai B'rith Garden City suburb  to Jerusalem were discussed at the  last meeting of the lodge upon receipt of the following Letter from the  Grand Lodge.  President Robbins appointed a  oommittee consisting of Mandel Nei-  ih r, ohairman, A. Spring, ,J. Kotkine  and J. Kaplan to devise ways and  means of raising the money. The  letter from the Grand Lodge follows:  TO THE LODGES OF THE INDEPENDENT ORDER OF B'NAI  B'RITH:  The Lodges will remember the article published in the June issue of  the B'nai B'rith News, which set  fori h plans for the B'nai B'rith &lt; car-  den City which Jerusalem Lodge is  undertaking to build as a suburb to  the city of Jerusalem. This suburb,  which will stand as a monument to  the benevolence of the Order, is intended as the contribution of our  members tO those whom the oppression of eastern Europe is driving toward Palest.inc. The new city is to  be constructed along the most modern, hygienic lines and once the initial impetus has been given it may  be expected to grow and spread  through its own efforts. Anyone who  is familiar with the crowded, unsanitary conditions within the city walls  will realize the necessity for the 68  tnblishnient of new residential sections where the Immigrants may be  afforded proper housing facilities and  enough land on which to raise I hen  own vegetables and fruit.  Appropriated $26,000  The   Executive  Committee of the  Order ai iis meeting in April, 1923,  appropriated $25,000 to the B'nai  B'rith Palestine House Building Fund  and directed that "appeals should be  made for the increase, and augmentation of this fund from time to time  by voluntary contributions." The  appropriation has been forwarded  and the initial steps towards the  purchase of the land, organization of  the trust fund and other legal details have been consummated. The  issuance of an appeal to the Lodges  has    been    postponed    pending    the  completion of this preliminary work.  Mem Lodge requires $250,000 as  the   minimum   amount   necessary   to  carry out the project.       • • •  Zionist leaders have wished the  Lodge success in its undertaking.  It should be understood, however,  that this is strictly a B'nai B'rith  undertaking, projected and carried  through by our Lodge in Jerusalem  with the aid and cooperation of the  Executive Committee and the American members.

SEATTLE  MA in 9689  COMMUNICATIONS  B'NAI B'RITH JUNIOR  ORDER BEING FORMED  Brother  Ben  Levin, Secy.  Seattle Lodge 503, I. 0. B. B.,  Seattle, Wash.  Dear  Brother:  I am submitting a report on the  Rosenblatt Concert, held on Sunday,  March 2nd, at The Hippodrome.  The affair was a huge success, insofar as bringing one of the greatest  Jewish artists to the. city of Seattle  under the auspices of the. Seattle  Lodge. The community showed its  appreciation by the wonderful applause rendered to Josef Rosenblatt.  Financially, it was not the success 1  anticipated, for the following reasons:  First, lack of time, which necessitated securing a dance hall without  proper seating facilities, making it  quite expensive in hauling seats,  selling them up, taking them down  and delivering them back to the  people from whom they were loaned;  second, lack of cooperation of certain groups in Jewish community.  The total attendance at the eon-  cert was somewhere in the neighborhood of 1400, with a total paid admission of 1258.   The difference was  made up of newspaper reporters,  special rates to vocal students,  those who worked on various committees, such as ushering, etc.  I want to take this opportunity to  thank those who worked efficiently  with me in making a, success of this  concert, i. e., brothers Manuel Nieder, Harry Nieder, Milton Malakoff,  .1. Kaplan and all those men wdio so  willingly gave their time on Sunday  morning in helping to set up the  seats.  A report will be sent to the Finan  cial Secretary covering receipts, expenditures and net profit. From  present figures, there wull be a net  profit of $802.00, which will go to the  fund for taking care of the War  Orphans thislyear.  Fraternally yours,  hhrman" siiaitro  Omaha, Neb.—A national junior  organization of the B'nai B'rith to  be known as the Aleph /.adi Aleph  is being formed, it was announced today by Samuel Beber of Omaha, who  said the purpose was to feach "Americanism and Judaism."

Summer Camp Fund  Dance on March 27  Representatives Answer  Lodge On Immigration  Five replies have been received hi  the resolution condemning the Johnson    Immigration    Bill    which    was  adopted at a recent meel ing of Seattle Lodge and copies of which were  sent to Washington's represents'  tives in Congress.  Following are. the letters received  by Secretary Ben Z. Levin:  From Rep. Albert Johnson—1 have  read with interest your letter of  February 2(1 with statements concerning the Immigration Bill now  before the House.  From Rep. Lin H. Hadley—I have  your letter of Feb. 20, setting forth  resolution adopted by your Lodge  relative to immigration legislation,  and I note I herein that you are opposed to the Johnson Immigration  Bill  now pending.  I thank you for advising me of  the views of your Lodge, and assure  you that the subject will have my  most, careful attention when il comes  before theII louse for consideration.  From Hep. John W. Summers—  The sentiment of Seattle Lodge, No.  503, I. 0. B. B., regarding the John  son Immigration Bill, shall be borne  in  mind when   this legislation   is before the House for consideration.  From  Senator Wesley L.   Jones  Your favor of February 28, enclosing  resolution of your Lodge, with reference   to   the  Johnson   Immigration  Bill, at hand.  I am glad to know the views of  your organization on this important  matter, and assure you that when  this bill comes up in the Senate it  will have my most careful attention.  From Senator C. C. Dill—In reply  to your letter of recent date. 1 can say  that I am strongly in favor of restricted immigration but I do nol  think we should discriminate against  any particular nations. I am in  favor of assimilating those aliens we  have here now, before we allow large  numbers to enter the United Stales.  Thanking you for your letter and  with best wishes.

On March 8, 1924, a Pool Room in  Kent was held up. frank H. Tilley,  the proprietor, instead of puffing up  «ushands, walked toward the hold-up  '";&gt;'. and  the latter fired,  wounding  'lley who died a few days later.  Ine following Monday, the Kent  Police arrested John Groger, a boy  seventeen years old, on suspioition of  ,''.''''« implicated in the shooting of  tilley. The boy was told that the  ,vu Jv,,,x Klan were ready to hang  '"." illl&lt;l, knowing the reputation of  this organization through newspaper  sports, stated that he shot Tilley and  ?* mentioned two or three other  nold-upa in which he was implicated.

SILVERMAN  RETURNS FROM  PALESTINE TRIP  RABBI  EMERITUS   OF  TEMPLE  EMANUEL SATISFIED WITH  CONDITIONS  New York (J.T.A.)—Dr. Joseph  Silverman, Rabbi Emeritus of Temple  Emanuel, has returned with Mrs. Silverman after a six months trip to  Palestime, Egypt and Europe. Dr.  Silverman visited Palestine with the  purpose of determining whether the  claims made for the restoration of the  country were justified by the facts,  and he says that he has eome back  satisfied with the conditions as he  found them.  "I visited forty Jewish colonies out  of sixty," said Dr. Silverman, "and  found the colonists working amicably  with their neighbors. The reports of  disturbances between the Jewish immigrants in Palestine and the Arabs  exists chiefly in the London newspapers and arc due to a small political  clique in that city who are against the  Balfour Mandate. The sixty colonies  are self-supporting and form the  nucleus of a great farming and horticultural industry. Palestine has already become again a land of milk  and honey, for on every side one sees  cows and bees."  KEREN HAYESOD DRIVE  FOR 1924 IS LAUNCHED  New fork (J. T. A.)—-At a public  reception given in honor of Dr. Silverman by the Palestine Foundation  Fund (Karon Hayesod), marking the  official launching of the 1924 campaign  to raise $3,000,000 for constructive  enterprises in Palestine, Dr. Silverman said: "Judaism is doomed to  destruction unless Palestine is built  up as Ihe great spiritual center of the  Jewish people."  "Judaism lives in Palestine as it  does no place else in the world," Dr.  Silverman concluded. "In Tel-Aviv  —that 100 percent Jewish city of  15,000—which fifteen years ago was  nothing but a barren sand waste, I  saw a Sabbath such as I have never  seen anywhere. Not a store was  opened, not a wheel turned, as the  entire city observed the Sabbath day.  Tel-Aviv on a Sabbath shows the  meaning of Palestine to the Jewish  religion."  CHESS PLAYER ARRIVES  New York (J.T.A.)—Dr. Emanuel  busker arrived here for the purpose of  participating in the World Chess  Tournament which is to take place  here.    Others who arc lo participate  in this tournament are Prof. Bogolu-  bow of Kief, Geza Moroczy of Budapest, Richard Reti of Vienna and Dr.  Savilly Tartakower of Vienna.  mailed as second-class matter. Advertising depends upon circulation,  and as soon as the Jews of Seattle and  the Northwest show their public  spirit by giving the Jewish Transcript  the support to which if is entitled,  Ihe   merchants  will   not   hesitate   to  advert ise.  The Jew ish Transcript enables you  to acquire a great deal of information  of interest to you, not only with reference to the doings among local  Jewry, but also of Jewish affairs elsewhere, which you could not probably  gel iii any oilier way, as it is not of  sufficient general interest to have I In-  daily papers publish it.  SABBATARIANS     EMIGRATE  TO PALESTINE  Constantinople (J. T. A.)—Fifteen representatives of the Sabbatarians, a Russian peas'iant sect  which observes the Sabbath on  Saturday, and other religious holidays and rituals of the Jews, arrived here together with one  hundred and nineteen Jewish refugees from Soviet Russia. They  will proceed to Palestine. This  sect, which is of a purely Russian  origin, has adopted many of the  Jewish religious customs, and has  lately even displayed a tendency  to settle in Palestine. This is the  first organized group of the Sabbatarians to leave Soviet Russia  for Palestine.  Chinese Hebrew  Records Found  New York (J.T.A.)—Adolph S.  Oko, librarian of the Hebrew Union  College in Cincinnati, has returned  to America with 59 Chinese Hebrew  manuscripts, bound in the original  Chinese silk, complete, records of  Hebraic community life and culture  in China during the Ming Dynasty  (1308-1044), of which all trace had  been believed lost.  The books which Mr. Oko brings to  this country constitute all of the  manuscripts known to have been  written by the Jews living in China.  Four additional manuscripts were  stolen .some years ago while on exhibition in London.  The manuscripts include hymnals  and prayer books which were brought  from China to London by the London  Society for Promoting Christianity  among the Jews in China, and were  purchased by missionaries of that  organization in the village of Kae-  Fung-foo.  Introduction to History  The introduction to the history  reads, in part, as follows:  "The money for the purchase of the  books was made available by a group  of Jews in the West, headed by Ben  Selling of Portland, Ore., and Rabbi  Jonah Wise, son of Isaac M. Wise,late  founder of the Hebrew Union College.  Accompanying the manuscripts is a  history of the experiences of the missionaries of the village of Kae-fung-  foo.  "Instead of being in the form of  scrolls, as might be expected, the  manuscripts are fan shaped. The oblong pages are folded one upon the  other and the reader pulls the pages  out fanwise.  "The history relates how in the  middle of the 19th century the once  powerful Jewish groups of China had  fallen into poverty and were victims  of persecution and starvation.  "Since the British Treaty of Nanking in 1842 many Christians in  Europe have directed their attention  toward the Jews in China. It was at  their request that the writer of these  introductory remarks undertook to  direct the general plan and management of the undertaking.  "Here in the midst of a surrounding  population, two-thirds of whom were  professors of Mohammedanism, and  close adjoining to a heathen temple  dedicated to the 'god of fire,' a few  Jewish families, sunk in the lowest  poverty and destitution, their religion scarcely more than a name, and  yet sufficient to separate them from  the multitude around exposed lo  trial, reproach and the pain of long-  deferred hope, remained the unconscious depositaries of the oracles of  Cod and survived as the soli.ary wit-  A. LOU COHEN ILL  Seriously ill for the past few weeks,  Mr. A. Lou Cohen, city councilman,  is reported to be considerably improved at the Providence Hospital.  Mr. Cohen was taken ill during his  campaign for reelection. It was  staled at his home that his condition  is improving steadily and he will soon  be able to see his friends.  COL. COX NEW ADVISOR  Jerusalem (J.T.A.)—Col. Charles  Cox has been appointed British advisor to the Trans Jordanian (lovernment, in place of Major Philby who  resigned because of disagreement with  Sir Herbert. Samuel.  Otto Kahn of New York, said to be  worth a hundred million dollars, is  the richest Jew in this country.  SUMMER CAMP  FUND DANCE TO BE  HELD THURSDAY  With all plans in readiness and  most of the tickets that were mailed  out already paid for, the B. B. Summer Camp Fund Dance to be held at  the Masonic Temple Thursday night,  March 27, is expected to be one of the  most successful affairs of the season.  Chairman B. B. Lustig of the Social  Service Committee and S. B. Asia in  charge of the ticket sale report a  great interest throughout the Jewish  community in tho coming dance.  One of the best jazz orchestras in  tho city has been secured to furnish  music for the occasion. All proceeds  from the dance will go toward the  summer oamp for three hundred boys  which will be established this summer by the B'nai B'rith in conjunction with the Y. M. H. A.  WILL WRITTEN IN HEBREW  Baltimore (J.T.A.)—The will of  Louis Herman, filed February 29 for  probate in the Orphans' Court, was  written in Hebrew. It was accompanied by the English translation.

Although according to the law, one representative  is allowed to 50,000 population, this  requirement was cut in order to enable the Jewish population of Ko-  momba, which is below that figure, to  have two representatives. They are  Joseph Pasha and Asian Cattani,  Vice President of the Cairo Kehillah.  The King furl her honored the Jews by  appointing Joseph Depicciota Bey,  Vice President of the Alexandria  Kehillah and founder of the Pro-Palestine Society, a memper of the  Egyptian Economic Council.  METULLAH TO BE  PALESTINE TERRITORY  Jerusalem (J.T.A.)—The Metullah  district which has long been a subject  for dispute between England and  Prance will, from April 1st, be n  eluded in the Palestine territory.  This territory was claimed by France  as a part of Syria because I lie natural  boundary line of Syria extended thru  it. England, on the other hand,  claimed this territory as a part of the  National Jewish Home in Palestine,  because of the Jewish colony established in Metullah. The present  sell lenient is considered a final one.  nesscs of departed glory. Not a  single individual could reach the  Hebrew books; they had been without  a rabbi for fifty years.  "The expectation of a Messiah  seems to have been entirely lost.  The rite of ciroumscision, which appears to have been observed at the  period of their discovery by the Jesuits two centuries ago, had been totally  discontinued. Out of seventy family  names or clans, only seven now remain, numbering about 200 individuals in all, dispersed over I he neighborhood."  New York (J.T.A.)—Rabbis and  representatives of Jewish societies  and lodges appeared before Mayor  Hylan and fellow members of the  Board of Estimate to plead that the  projected plan for a parkway through  Cypress Hill and Mount Carmel cem-  etaries to relieve traffic conditions between Brooklyn and Queens be  vetoed.  The Rabbis quoted the Hebrew religion to show that it would be directly against it to move the bodies from  their graves. Without committing  himself definitely, Mayor Hylan indicated that he would not vote for the  road as planned. Inquiries during  tho hearing indicated that not only  Mayor Hylan but Borough President  .Miller of Manhattan and Comptroller  Craig were opposed to the plan if it  involved the disturbing of graves.  TALMUD STUDENT DIES  Bucharest (J.T.A.)—Rabbi Meyer  Rabinowitoh died in Harlau at the  age of 40 years. Rabbi Rabinowitch  was known throughout Europe as a  great Talmudist and despite the fact  that he was still a young man had  written a large number of books on  rabbinical learning.  Mr. Adolph Sutro, who came to  California from Germany in ISIS,  made the Sutro tunnel, one of the  in,,si wonderful accomplishments of  engineering, possible, thus overcom-  ng one of the greatest dangers in thei  famous Comstock lode, which opened  one of the greatest silver mines in the  country.

DETROIT HAS 42,000 JEWS  Detroit (J. T. A.)—Detroit Jews  number only 42,000 souls, according  to a survey just completed by the  Bureau of Jewish Social Research of  New York. Until now, estimates of  the number of Jews here varied from  05,000 to 100,000. The survey also  reveals that 40% of the Jewish children of Detroit are receiving a Jewish  education, this percentage being the  second highest in the country, Detroit ranking next to Pittsburgh.  ARABS SUPPORT KING HUSSEIN  Jerusalem (J. T. A.)—The conference of Moslem notables and inufthis  held here acknowledged King Hussein  of Hedjas as Caliph and issued a  strong appeal to tho Moslem population of Palestine urging them to  recognize the new Caliph. The appeal  emphasized the honor bestowed upon  the Arab nations in the ascension to  the Caliphate of an Arab after four  hundred years during which it was  held outside of the Arab countries.

Kast Spruce St.  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  New York (J. T. A.)—Prominent  Chassidic Rabbis and leaders of orthodox congregations are engaged in  an extensive drive for the purpose of  raising a sum of money sufficient lo  provide those Ukrainian Jews who  are in need with matzoths for the  coming Passover holidays. This is  in accordance with the old tradition  among the Jewish people of taking  particular care of the poor during  the Passover holidays, especially in  providing them with matzoths.  16,000 Jews In Need  According to the figures received  here by the Campaign Committee  the city of Kiev alone has about  15,000 Jews who are without the  means of supplying themselves with  this necessary food for the holidays.  The call which has been sent, out by  tho campaign committee in New  York to the congregations all over  the country has already met with  some response, the orthodox congregations in the city of Philadelphia  pledging themselves to the amount of  $10,000. Similar response is expected  from other large Jewish centers. It  is tho purpose of the Committee to  take care also of the Ukrainian Jews  who are stranded in various parts of  Europe.  JEWISH NATIONAL COUNCIL  IN KOVNO LEGALIZED  Kovno (J.T.A.)—Dr. Samson Ros  enbaum, former Minister of Jewish  Affairs, has completed a bill legalizing  the Jewish National Council. The  bill also provides that every Jew who  declares himself unwilling to join the  Jewish Community is automatically  exempt, from any Jewish obligations.  It is not believed, however, that any  Jew will take advantage of this  provision which was introduced to  satisfy the objections of the anti-  Semites who claimed that the legalization of the Jewish National Council would create a state within a slate  in Lithuania.  RABBI'S INJURIES FATAL  Philadelphia (J.T.A.)—Rabbi Alexander Gross, cantor emeritus of the  Congregation Adapth Jesurun, died  from injuries received when he was  struck by a motor car.

ZIONIST ACTIVITIES  PALESTINE A "CALIFORNIA"  That Palestine is destined to become "the Southern California of  Asia" was the opinion expressed by  Professor Elwood Mead of the University of California in his first pub-  lie report on his survey of Palestine,  made at the invitation of the World  Zionist organization. His report  was given at a meeting at the Hotel  Astor held under the auspices of the  Palestine Foundation Fund of which  Samuel Untermyer is President.  David A. Brown of Detroit also  spoke, declaring that service and not  enthusiasm will rebuild the Jewish  national homeland. Judge Bernard  A. Rosenblatt presided.  Professor Mead said that the rural  colonization of Palestine has passed  the pioneer period and that the  country boars a remarkable resemblance to California. He referred to  Benjamina, one of the most flourishing colonies in Palestine, which is  composed entirely of graduates of  the California College of Agriculture.  "Science, skill and industry can  make of the plain of Esdralon and the  Valley of Jezrcll", he said, "as groat  a picture of rural charm and agricultural opulence as now gladdens  one's vision in going from Los Angeles to San Bernardino.  "The Jews are bringing to their  ancient homeland the same optimism  and energy which characterize my  home State."  Funds for the development and the  financing of land buying on a large  scale are the immediate need in the  rebuilding of Palestine, according to  Professor Mead.  HADASSAH APPOINTS  REPRESENTATIVES  The National Board of Hadassah,  the Women's Zionist Organization,  announces the appointment of Mrs.  Nellie Straus Mochenson as its official  representative in Palestine.  Expansion of activity, and the  growing interest on the part of the  American Jewish Woman in the actual  details of Hadassah services in Palestine, have made imperative the establishment of a personal contact  between Hadassah and its Palestine  agencies.   DR. WEIZMANN MEETS  NEW YORK JOUNALISTS  New York—A luncheon was given  at the Ritz-Carlfon by Herman Bernstein, editor of the Jewish Tribune, so  that Dr. Chairn Woizmnnn might  meet a group of New York journalists  in advance of the New York City  campaign of the Keren llayesod. Dr.  Weizmann in his speech said that the  Jew is of inestimable value in reclaiming the desert and waste lands of the  Near East in cooperation with the  Arabs, that 2,500,000 frees have been  planted, roads built, swamps drained  and olive and orange groves cultivated. He claimed Ihal the rcpoists  of trouble with the Arabs had been  greatly exaggerated and that at  present there was no friction worth  mentioning. Among the guests at the  luncheon were S. S. McClure, the  publisher, Dr. Gharles II. Levermorc,  winner of the Bok Peace Prize, Norman EapgOOd, Prof. .lames Melvin  Lee, John O'llara Cosgrove, Charles  T. Thompson of the Associated Press  and many prominent publicists.  RARE LIBRARY ACQUIRED  London (J.T.A.)—A rare library of  ancient oriental and Hebrew literature has been purchased for the  University of Jerusalem by the London committee of the University.  The library, which consists of 0,000  volumes, was formerly the property  of the learned Jewish professor Gold-  ziher of Hungary. It is understood  that the Hungarian Government has  already given permission to have the  library taken out of the country.  Action Committee  Conference Closed  London (J. T. A.)—The Actions  Committee of the World Zionist Organization, meeting here in confer  enee, has, after a week's heated discussion of the question of the formation of the Jewish Agency, adopted a  resolution which welcomes the recently displayed willingness of important  non-Zionist circles to participate in  I lie upbuilding of the Jewish National  Home in Palestine. The resolution  gives particular expression to the  Actions Committee's gratification  with the resolution adopted at the  conference of the American non-Zionists, held in New York on February  17th, under the Chairmanship of Mr.  Louis Marshall.  The resolution also expresses satisfaction with the fact that the Jewish  I r.ide unions of America, who were, up  to now, indifferent to the Palestine,  problems, have now taken another  course in the matter and have decided  to participate in the upbuilding of  Palestine. These events, the resolution goes on to say, are important as  basic factors in securing the cooperation of the entire Jewry toward the  upbuilding of the Jewish National  Homeland. The Actions Committee  requests, therefore, that the Executive continue its efforts for the purpose of forming a Jewish Palestine  Council which should cooperate with  the Jewish Agency.  The Actions Committee expresses,  finally, its strong conviction that the  Jewish people are willing to carry out  the grea t task of upbuilding Palestine,  and the Zionist'Organization is, therefore, prepared to do everything to  bring about an harmonious collaboration on the basis of joint duties and  joint responsibilities.  PALESTINE NATIONAL  ASSEMBLY IS OPENED  Jerusalem (J.T.A.)—The third session of the National Assembly of  Pallestine Jewry opened on March  24th.    The Executive Committee of  the National Assembly has published  a draft of the election laws for the New  National Assembly which is to be convoked later. The draft which will be  discussed at the third session of the  present Assembly provides that the  right to vote for officers to the National Assembly should be given to every  man and woman over the age of 20,  and the right to stand for election to  every man and woman over the age of  25.    Representation  is to  be on  a  proportional basis, one deputy being  elected for every 300 electors.  RABBIS PURCHASE LAND  Jerusalem (J. T. A.)—Announce)  nieiif has just been made of the good  results of the recent visits to Palestine by the Polish Rabbis and Industrialists. The visitors have decided to establish a spinning factory  in Tel Aviv with a capital of 10,000  pounds. Tin' Gerer and Sokolower  Rabbis are the chief shareholders.  Another result of the visits has been  tho purchase of thousands of dunain  of land in the neighborhood of Tiberias, Jaffa, Pctach Tikvah and other  colonies.

One of its worst features is the  revival of talk about Nordic supremacy. In the  world we want, men and women could move about  as freely between nations as they now move between  states of our Union. Unfortunately, as things are,  economic reasons, and especially different standards  of living, making unrestricted immigration into the  United States undesirable. But that fact does not  justify laws which play upon and increase racial  prejudice. The notion that there is a Nordic race,  defined by type and skull, superior to all other races  is false. A homogeneous people like the French,  for instance, is, as scientists have demonstrated,  made up of men of three main racial stocks, Mediterranean, Alpine, and Nordic, defined by three different shapes of skull. These races have absolutely  amalgamated and it cannot be proved that the contribution of one of them to French life is superior  to the others. Here in America a lot of people who  claim to be Nordic are not Nordic a&gt;nd it does not.  make any difference whether they are or not. Preachers of Nordicism are a kind of highbrow Ku Klux  Klan who try to disguise themselves in pseudo-  scientific jargon instead of nightgowns. You can no  more tell what is in a man's skull by looking at its  shape from the outside than you can tell what kind  of chickens live in a hen house by looking at its  roof, and that goes for races as well as individuals.  —Norman Thomas.  THE Y AND JEWISH EDUCATION  **^\NE danger to America is that those who come  ^-^ here will break with their past. People need  something to which they can tie. They need that,  obedience which is born of reverence. The sentiment of reverence comes only from knowledge.  There is room in our country for everything that is  good; there is no restraint here save against evil.  Those who come to our shores must bring what  they have which is good with them and never cease  to cherish it. No person who is false to his own  nationality can be true to America.  "Teach, the ancient landmarks to the youth of  the Jewish race. Let them learn to venerate freedom by coming into a knowledge of the truth. That  learning and wisdom which has been a sustaining  influence to the Jewish race through all the centuries  must be preserved for the benefit of mankind,"  So speaks President Coolidge of the Jew. The  utterance of the President calls for greater interest  of the Jew along Jewish lines. They would have a  Jew hold fast and true to his heritage.  True education must liberate the deeper self of  the individual today and of the streams that run in  tin- past of the individual. We who are Jews are  two things—we are Americans and we are Jews.  The two do not overlap—indeed, they supplement.  One heritage is political, the other is a glorious Hebrew one. The Jew who would be called an educated Jew is certainly a poor imitation if he has absorbed the culture of the land in which he lives without knowing the culture of the people from whom  he  has  sprung.  The problem of Jewish education is the problem  of every generation of Jews. We must pass on the  flaming torch of Jewish learning from father to son  and from son to younger brother, each generation  enriching the mass and being enriched in turn.  We all bear a responsibility. Our duty is to  forge living links between the past and present and  the present and future. The Y. M. 11. A. aids in  this God-like task. You who read these lines must  strengthen it and aid with your vision and sympathy.  Only then can you give to America this line spirit  of which President Coolidge speaks and be faithful  to the land of Jefferson and Lincoln.  —St. Louis Y Journal.  FORD AND EUROPEAN ANTI-SEMITISM  ■QKRL1N (J. T. A.)—An investigation by the  ■*-' Berlin bureau of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reveals the connection of Henry Ford, Ameri  can motor magnate, with the anti-Semitic movement in Central Europe. It also discloses the fact  that the violent anti-Semitic propaganda which  started in Europe in 1921 was based on Henry Ford's  book, "The International Jew".  The investigation of the J. T. A. establishes the  fact that Ford's agents in Europe are constantly associating with rabid anti-Semites, an instance being  the disclosures concerning Titus DeBobula and his  part in the Budapest monarchist conspiracy to overthrow the Hungarian Government, in intimate cooperation with the German monarchists, especially  the Mitler-Ludendorf group.  A special investigation into the anti-Semitic agitation in Bohemia also points to Ford's connection  there. The anti-Semitic agitation followed immediately upon the alleged visit of Henry Ford to Carlsbad. The anti-Semitic press in Europe in announcing this intended visit declared its purpose to be to  confer with anti-Semitic leaders concerning future  propaganda. A search of official sources in Carlsbad  showed that considerable correspondence addressed  to Henry Ford from anti-Semitic leaders arrived in  Carlsbad during the period when Ford was supposed  to be there. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency has established, however, that ford himself never came to  Carlsbad, but the chief European representative of  the Ford Motor Company, Henry Lange, who resides in London, came in his stead. Mr. Lange  registered in the visitors list of Carlsbad in September, 1922, and associated himself exclusively with  well-known anti-Semites, particularly with Engineer  Weiss, a rabid anti-Semite. Lange, it is said, stated  that he not only represented the Ford Motor Company, but, was Ford's personal confidential agent.  It is known that Lange had many conferences with  German Nationalist leaders, especially with Mr.  Jung, German National Representative in the Czecho-  Slovakian Parliament. The anti-Semitic agitation  throughout Czechoslovakia followed immediately upon Lange's visit to Carlsbad. A flood of anti-Semitic literature swept over Czccho-Slovakia from Leip-  sig and Munich.  It can very readily be seen that outside influences were responsible for the anti-Semitic propaganda among the Germans in Bohemia, because  under ordinary circumstances, the Germans being a  minority group in Czccho-Slovakia, their interests  lay with the Jews, another minority group, allied to  them in language, culture and political affiliations;  and anti-Semitic propaganda would lose for them  their staunchest allies, and harm greatly their political interest. Ford's money is generally seen behind the anti-Semitic movement in K.urope as it. is  impossible to believe that the huge sums spent for  the publication of propaganda and the payment and  support of numerous officials and organizations  could be raised in Europe.  It is known that violent anti-Semitic propaganda has even been carried into countries with an  insignificant Jewish population, like the Scandinavian countries and Switzerland. Translations of  Ford's book appeared in every language and in all  countries of Europe and was distributed very widely.  While no documentary proof of Ford's connection with the anti-Semitic propaganda in Europe  can be obtained, it is known that anti-Semitic agitators like Titus DeBobula and others, openly boast  of their connection with Ford, and this fact, together  with the evidence mentioned before clearly establishes at least indirectly, the relation between the  Detroit manufacturer and the anti-Semitic agitation  in Europe.  In well informed Jewish circles here it is believed  that Ford also associates with tin- Russian monarchists. The fact that well-known European anti-  Semites, like General Haller, while in America, always pay a visit to Ford in Detroit, would seem to  bear out this belief.

T. A.)—In order to controvert propaganda current for several years that the B'nai  B'rith order is in any sense a "secret" order banded  together for un-American purposes, the first public  initiation was conducted on March 12 by Dr. Julius  H. Meyer and Dr. Louis L. Mann, Rabbi of Sinai  Temple, as monitor. Thirty-eight candidates for  membership were inducted into the Chicago Lodge,  1. (). B.

Brushingham and Frank Sullivan, acting exalted  ruler of the Chicago lodge of Elks.  This public ceremony presages a policy of throwing open the lodge rooms to the public in proof that  the order B'nai B'rith stands on an equal footing  with all other American fraternal organizations in  its Americanism and sense of civic duty.

It was but natural that the World  War should have left in its wake a  multitude of dissatisfied souls, disgruntled politicians, disillusioned  war-makers, and heart-broken men  of thwarted ambitions. The war had  resulted in changes stupendous in  extent, well-nigh cataclysmic in character, fortunes were lost, aristocracies were humbled, thrones were  overthrown,   empires   dismembered.  If was also natural that those who  had been shipwrecked during the  storm should have regarded their  fate with amazement and stupefaction, and that they should have  looked about for the cause of their  downfall. Many still retained sufficient clarity of vision to sec in the  aftermath the logical effect of a long  (rain of natural causes. But there  were some wdio, ignorant of history,  devoid of knowledge of world economy, looked for a simpler explanation of their plight, sought, a single  key that would unlock what was to  I hem a mystery—in a word, these  elements looked about for a scapegoat upon which to heap the odium  of having brought about the war  and all the evils that accompanied  and followed it, especially the particular misfortunes which had been  visited upon these malcontents themselves.  The Scapegoat  for generations there had existed  in Europe such a scapegoat in the  person of the JEW! Several members of that race had occupied posts  of responsibility and trust in the  councils of all belligerent countries.  Men of Jewish descent were among |  the delegates to the Peace Conference and among the advisory bodies  of experts. Several of the leaders of  both revolutions in Russia were  Jews. In the dark days of post-  bellum confusion in Hungary and in  Germany, .some of those who played  prominent roles were Jews. These  facts were sufficient in tho eyes of  the Russian black hundreds, the  German Junkers, the. French royalists, and the foes of existing administrations in all countries, to establish a complete case against the Jewish people as the authors of the  world's unrest.  Almost simultaneously wilh the  firing of the last shot of the war,  there began a propaganda against  the Jew unmatched in virulence, unparalleled in extent by any racial agitation of the. past one hundred years,  former agents of the Russian bureaucracy gave tremendous impetus to  the agitation by the circulation of a  mysterious "document" which has  since become notorious as one of the  most clumsy literary forgeries of  modern times, the so-called "Protocols of the  Learned   Elders of Zion."  Imported Propaganda  Through their sinister machinations, the European reactionaries  imported this unworthy propaganda  into the United States and succeeded  in securing here a number of accomplices, the most conspicuous of  whom was Henry Ford. In May,  1920, Mr. Ford opened the columns  of his Dearborn Independent to the  publication of a series of anonymous  ail ides, with the. avowed purpose of  showing that the Jewish people have  exercised and are today exercising a  deleterious and malignant influence  in world affairs. The wide circulation given to these articles prepared  the ground for publications along  similar lines, and the past few years  have witnessed the dissemination of  the most shameful calumnies and  distortions of truth which have in  them the seeds of a race conflict  wholly foreign to the spirit of America and threatening the very funds  mentals of our instil ill ions.  Christians Protest  In January,  1921,  (here was made  public a protest signed by one hun  dred and nineteen distinguished  American oil incus "of (lent ile birth  and Christian faith," against this  "organized campaign of anti-Semitism, conducted in close conformity  to and cooperation with similar campaigns in Europe." The protest-  ants, who were led by ex-Presidents  Taft and Wilson, declared:  "We believe it should not be  left to men and women of Jewish  faith to fight this evil, but that it  is in a very special sense the duty  of citizens who are not Jews by  ancestry or faith, We, therefore,  make earnest protest against this  vicious propaganda, and call upon  our fellow-citizens of Gentile birth  and Christian faith to unite their  efforts to ours, to the. end that if  may be crushed. In particular, we  call upon all those who are moulders of public opinion—the clergyman and minister of all Christian  .churches, publicists, teachers, editors and statesmen—to strike at  this un-American and un-Christian  agitation."  The meaning of these leaders of  public opinion in America was that  the so-called "Jewish question" is,  in America al leasl, act ually a Christian question, because tho continuance of this propaganda involved Ihe  honor and the self-respect of the  Christians of America.  It is from this exalted standpoint  that Miss Ada Sterling has written  "The Jew and Civilization." Miss  Sterling lifts the curtain of cynical  misrepresentation and falsehood behind which propagandists have  sought to conceal Ihe truth about  the Jewish people, and she attempts  to give this people the rightful place  in the ranks of those races which  have done the constructive work of  the world. The author traces wilh  sympathy and insight the role of the  Jew as citizen and patriot, in industry, commerce, finance, philanthropy, literature, art, music, science,  agriculture, jurisprudence, statesmanship, and diplomacy, and his  services to the world as a moral force.  Only facts arc presented, but facts  of a sort which are more romantic  and more fascinating than fiction,  written in the vigorous and charming style of a master. In Miss Sterling's book, idealism, truth and humanity come again info their own.  It is a touching, thrilling, absorbing  story of noble achievement against  stupendous odds, of the triumph of  the will to serve, in spile of a multitude of obstacles.  The indisputable historical data  which the writer presents, as tho  fruit of long study and extensive research, show that the authors of the  reoent     anti-Semitic     diatribes     are  themselves deserving of the obloquy  and opprobrium which they have so  shamelessly   sought   lo   fasten   upon  the Jews.  If is the author's hope that the  volume "may incite the conservative good who have been negative to  the thought of a better understanding of their neighbor, the Jew, to  fake part in the suppression of those  forces for evil which would set the  nation, and the nations, once more  upon a course of Middle Ages persecution." It will do more. American  citizens "of * lentile birth and Christian faith" who "ill read Ihe fascinating chapters of Miss Sterling's  book will inevitably reach the eon  elusion that the Jews are entitled  not only to a "square deal" at the  hands of their non-Jewish I'ellowinen,  but also to the world's gratitude.  This conclusion will ennoble the soul  of him who reaches it, it will purify  the conscience of Ihe world, and il  will give back lo America "I lie upward looking ami Ihe light" of which  men of un-ChrisI ian temper and un-  Ainerieau heart have sought, to rob  our beloved country. -The Jewish  Tribune.							2015-11-08	2015-11-08	http://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org:80/cdm/ref/collection/p16118coll10/id/24	24	25.jpg	/p16118coll10/image/25.jpg

Hi'  is often referred to as a "nasal architect." He  is not. only a surgical master, hut an artist at the  same lime.    He can turn Long noses into short  DOBeS, ami ugly ones into beautiful feat iirci I  to our knowledge is the only surgeon in this  country performing the famous Fuch's opera-  linn for straighleiiing cross eycB in fourminut.es  without pain. He is also, as far as we know, the  only Jew in this country practising plastic  surgery with such tremendous success, lie is a  disciple of Professors Joseph and  Israel of the  Berlin   University,   the   two   internationally  famous German Jewish surgeons who developed  Ihe science and all of plaslic surgery.  His article on   I In- Jewish   mist' is interesting  from many points of view, and is a notable  contribution to Jewish anthropology and race  history. -  A man is physically and psychologically what his nose is, and a  race, too, can be judged and recognized by its nose. A nose is great ly  indicative of the character of the individual and of the race. It is surely  not an accident that, wilh feu exceptions, all great men have long  noses Ihe exceptions going to prove.  the  rule.  The Nordic man is generally spoken of, and represented to be, the actual homo sapiens, but the great  Nordic men have seldom had Nordic  noses. Nearly all the great composers, painters, writers and poets  have had long noses. That the  length and formation of the nose has  something to do with the intelligence of the individual, and is indicative of his braininess, can be seen  from two facts first, the nose of the  city dweller is, as every one can observe daily, somewhat longer than  that of the villager; secondly, that  the race of the shortest nose, the  Celtic, has produced less great men  than the Nordic, Gothic or Semitic  races. The nations affiliated with  the Celtic race have even failed to  raise any of their languages to the  dignity of a national language. The  Celtie languages are all dialects, and  their literatures have only a folk-  loristic value. Any anthropologist  will tell you, moreover, that the  Celtie nose is the shortest one, just  as the Hebraic, or, as it is more  generally termed, the Semitic nose,  is the longest.  Nose Is Characteristic  For this reason, this is what is  most characteristic in the external  appearance of the Semitic race. Tho  Jew, of course, is recognizable as  such by all the other facial features  us well, but his long nose is admitted  to be his most striking characteristic.  Many a Jew, especially if he belongs  to the class of social climbers, anxious not to be recognized as a Jew,  deplores his racial nose; anil, before  plastic surgery was created by two  Jewish scientists, Professors Israel  and Joseph of the Berlin University,  these long nosed Jews used to bitterly complain that they could give up  Ihe religion of Moses, but could not  get rid of their noses, and baptism  did not change their social status.  Now it is different. A long nose can  easily be shortened, and many Jews,  and a still greater number of Jewesses, make ample use of the discoveries of plastic surgery to shorten  and beautify their noses.  But the Jew should find consolation in the fact that the nose which  so often provokes trouble for him is  indicative of the intelligence of his  race. To fully realize the importance of his nose, he has only to look,  for instance, at the ignorant Russian  moiijik, who, like most of the ignorant Slavs, is short-nosed. The highly cultured Western European nations, and especially the city dwellers amongst them, have much longer  noses; and one cannot possibly imagine a really creative and great artist, poet, statesman or philosopher  with tho nose of a Slav peasant.  Intelligence And The Nose  What has been said regarding the  connection of his intelligence and  nose is true not only of the highly  cultured Jew of the Western countries, but even of the primitive Jew  of the Eastern countries. Potentially, both are alike brainy and intellectual; for we have often seen that  Ihe primitive Eastern Jew, living a  very primitive life, and thinking in  terms of the fifteenth century, develops within a very short time into  a modern man, jumps to a mental development four hundred years in advance of his compatriots, and becomes a full-fledged citizen of the  twentieth century. Solomon Maimon  is a case in point. Solomon Maimon,  a poor, ignorant Lithuanian Jew,  left his village without even the knowledge of the alphabet, came to Koen-  igsburg, Prussia, and after a short  stay in the country became not. only  one of the foremost German philosophers, but the sharpest critic of  Kant's philosophy. Within a very  short time the ignorant and primitive Lithuanian Jew became one of  the pillars of the philosophy of the  West. I could quote many similar  instances to show that the Eastern  Jew, so far as his potential intellectuality is concerned, is on a par with  the Western. The less able Southern Russian Jew, who is supposed to  AGENCY DENIES POGROMS  Moscow (J. T. A.)—The Russian  Telegraphic Agency circulated an  oflicial statement denying the reports  that have appeared in the foreign  press to the effct that pogroms  against the Jews had occured in the  Ukraine lately. These rumors declares the statement, arc absolutely  untrue and have been circulated by  the Roumanian press, apparently  under the inspiration of the Roumanian Government for the purpose  of influencing public opinion abroad  in disfavor of the Soviet Government  in the matter of Bessarabia. The  question of Bessarabia, the possession of which is in dispute between  Russia and Roumania, will be taken  up, it is expected, at the Russia-  Roumanian Conference which is to be  held shortly in Vienna.  JEWS TERRORIZED  Vienna (J.T.A.)—The Jewish population of Zagreb have been subjected  to further attacks by the Coatian  Nationalists. Restaurants patronized by Jews were stormed, meetings  were broken up and stink-bombs were  thrown into the rooms of Jewish  students.   Many Jews were wounded.  be a descendant of a mixed race, is,  in fact, lacking many of the anatomic  and physiological characteristics of  the Lithuanian, Polish and Western  Jew. His nose is short, his hair is  rather blond, his face round, his eye  of light color, and in many instances  he can be taken for a real Russian  'Ihe most creative Jewish groups arc  probably the German and French,  and both of them are long-nosed.  Tho German Jews form a group of  only half a million, yet have produced more great men in one hundred  years than any other five European  nations combined. They have produced such philosophers as Maimon,  Lazarus, Simmel and Cohen; such  musicians as Mendelsohn and Meyerbeer; such scientists as Ehrlich,  VVeigart, Stcinadi and Freud; such  mathematicians and physicists as  Einstein and Minkowsky; such statesmen as Stahl, Cremieux, Lasker,  Bramberger and Rathenau. The  French Jews, too, although only  150,000 in number, have produced a  number of great men quite out of  proportion to their numerical  strength. And these two Jewish  groups, the ablest and the most creative, art! remarkably long-nosed.  All of which goes to prove that the  long Jewish nose is indicative of intellectual superiority.  Long And Short Of It  A well-known German nose specialist several years ago wrote a book  called "The Short and the Long  Nose", which is very interesting.  He enumerates all the greatest, men  of tho world's history, establishes  the fact that with very few exceptions all of them had long noses,  and comes to the conclusion that  creative intellectuality postulates a  long nose. This German specialist  comes to this conclusion, not as a  result of anatomic and physiological  investigations, but by way of historical experience. He Baid little, however, about the relation of the long  nose to the general anatomic and  physiological make-up of these great  men. He did not go into the cause  of the skeleton phenomenon at all,  but merely stated a fact—great and  able men have long noses. But thai  there must be a certain relationship  between the level of culture and the  nose of a race is an inevitable conclusion when we observe all the  short-nosed races in the rearmost  ranks of culture and civilization.  It has been left to modern science,  and in particular the newer chemistry of the secretions of the ductless  glands, to make the first efforts to  explain   this   obvious,   but  hitherto  OBJECTS TO JEWS IN  ART DEPARTMENT  Warsaw (J.T.A.)—A demand that  Polish art be freed of any Jewish influence, however slight, has been  directed to the Ministry of Education  by M. Skotnitzki, Director of the  Government Art Department. Skot-  nitzki's demands include the exclusion from office in the Art Department  of anyone who is even a descendant of  a Jew, whether or not his forefathers  have been baptized.  Coincident with this incident, it is  announced that tho Jewish Art  Society of Warsaw has determined  upon the construction of a Jewish  Palace of Art and Culture.  ANTI-SEMITES   DENY    CHRIST  Berlin (J.T.A.)—At a flag-raising  ceremony in the Protestant Lorenz  Church at N urn berg, by the Steel  Helmet Front Association, a war  veteran's organization, when the  preacher said "Our Lord, Jesus  Christ," many in the audience ex  claimed "Jew's son. Don't tell us  about the Jew's son," according to a  report appearing in the Volkszci-  tung. This is but one outbreak of  many which have been reported,  showing a tendency on the part of  the anti-Semites to deny even Christ  because ho was a Jew.  unaccountable, relationship. It has  been incontrovertibly established  that the internal secretions exorcise  a dominating influence upon the  brain and nervous system, and are,  in fact, the real governors of physical  appearance, instincts and dispositions, emotions and reactions, character and temperament. Although  it is scarcely half a century since the  importance of the ductless glands  and their secretions was discovered,  so intensive has been their study,  already it has been possible to classify races and individuals according  to the dominance in their make-up  of one or other of these glands.  An Interesting Discussion  A discussion of the various glands  and the types dominated by them,  would be interesting, but outside the  scope of this article, which is concerned alone with the Jew. Suffice  it to say that the Jew is a pituitary  type, and the pituitary gland has  much to do with the growth of bone  and cartilage; also a mass of evidence has been collected showing  that it controls, or better, energizes  the tender emotions, sympathy and  suggestibility. Its secretions act  upon the great basal ganglia, at the  base of the brain, which contain the  nerve cells and fibres which arc the  centers of emotional control and coordination. To the dominance of  this gland, then, and its two-fold  influence of bone formation and  emotionalism, especially as deep  emotions cause deep respiration,  may be attributed the nose of the  Jew. While, however, this is undoubtedly the principal causative  factor, it is impossible that the  habit engendered of fear, of carrying  his head bent throughout centuries  of persecution, may be a eontribut-  ive factor, for with the head held inward, the deep breaths inhaled would  naturally strike against the middle of  the nose instead of being drawn directly into the lungs. While, it is  true, the characteristics of the Jewish nose have ever been what they  are today-large hump or hook and  curved scpliunif must be borne in  mind that we know little or nothing  of the history of the race prior to the  time of Abraham, and Abraham, the  traditional "father" appears on the  scene flying before the invading  Klamilcs. Negative proof of the fact  that his nose and pituitary are inseparably connected in the Jew, is  found in the fact that undevelop-  ment of this gland always means a  small nose.  Since time immemorial, the Jews  have been considered a very productive race from a biological point of  WILL ABOLISH RABBINATE  Constantinople (J. T. A.)—That  Turkey intends to abolish the Grand  Rabbinate and cancel all the privcl-  eges enjoyed by the Hakam Bashi  since ancient times, as part of the  religious reforms contemplated by!  the Government, is the report of one  of the most influential Turkish  Deputies. The institution of the  Hakam Bashi included official status  in the government, and the power to;  apportion and collect the special  taxes of the Jews.  HEAVY   STORMS   IN   UKRAINE  Kiev (J.T.A.)—Duo to heavy snow  storms and blizzrds lasting for al  whole week, the Ukrainian railway  lines are blocked and communication  has been out off for the past three days  with the Crimea. The districts south  of Melitopol have been submerged by  the snow, the telephones and telegraphs deranged and trains loaded  with coal and timber held up.  JEWS IN POLAND URGED TO  SUBSCRIBE TO STATE BANK  Warsaw (J.T.A.)—The Jewish press  is continuing its appeals to the Jewish population to buy shares in the  new Polish State Bank. "Although,"  it states, "we Jews are opposed to the  present government, we are faithful  citizens, and as such must fulfill our  citizenship duties."  SYNAGOGUE   CONVERTED  INTO WORKERS' HOMES  Moscow (J.T.A.)—The executive  committee of the Building Commissary has decreed the confiscation of  the synagogue on Novoslobofka Slit intends to convert this building  into dwellings for the workers in the  adjoining timber factory.  view, and it has likewise been proven  that the maternal instinct is directly  connected with a proper function of  the pituitary endocrines.  The outstanding characteristics of  the pituitary type are the bony .  prominence of the face, square or  projecting jaw, high, thick, straight  or hooked nose, heavy eyebrows,  high cheek bones—all distinguishing  features of the Jew. On the other,!  hand, we sometimes meet a sub-pituitary type of Jew, with round, full-  moon face, check bones buried under  fat, (latter and broader nose and  marked complacency of tranquility  of expression, often amounting to actual dullness.  One other fact, so what outside  of our subject, but nevertheless  curious, may be mentioned in con- '•  nection with tho nose of the Jew.  Anatomy shows that only a small  portion of the mucous membrane  which lines the nostrils is the seat of  the endings of the nerves of smell.  In Ihe ordinary course of expiration  the air does not touch this olfactory  region. The Jewish nose is so built  that he unconsciously guides the air  Impregnated with the odors of tin'  food he eats into that small area,  which accounts for the good appetite and enjoyment of his food characteristic of the Jew. That is why  he is so particular about the meat  he eats being fresh. His developed  sense of smell revolts against dead  meat, and this in turn is the explain  ali if the institution of sehcehifah-  While, then, the nose of the Jew  may not meet with the aesthetic requirements and tastes of today, and  may not win prizes in beauty contests, instead of deploring, the Jew  has reason to be proud of his distinctive racial characteristic, for it always  has been, and always will be indicative of his superior intelligence, of  mature intellectuality, of steadfast!  ncss and will-power. It has a reasol)  and a history which should amply  compensate for any cosmetic disadvantage.  (Copyright,    1924,    Jewish    Tele  graphic   Agency.)

ONE ON THE JUDGE  In a magistrate's court the other  say a witness was being examined in a  case where the defendant was charged  with breaking the windshield of an  automobile with a large stone.  "Was it as big as this book?" inquired the judge.  "Why, yes, it was much larger,"  replied the willing witness.  "Was it as big as these two books  together?"  "Much bigger."  "Was it as large as my head?"  "It was as long, but not so thick,"  replied the witness, amid much  laughter.  COMMUNICATIONS  To the Jewish Public:  The Y.M.H.A., in order to settle  the debts held on its building and  clubrooms, situated at 17th and East  Union Street, has planned a novel  affair.  On the 4th of May a Grand Bazaar  and Festival will be held at the club-  rooms at which time numerous articles of various values will be raffled  and auctioned off to the highest  bidder. In this manner it is expected  that enough money will be raised to  free the Y.M.H.A. of encumbrances.  In order to make this venture, for  venture it is, a complete success, the  co-operation of every Jew in Seattle  is urged. You must contribute your  bit towards making the Y.M.H.A. of  Seattle a greater and more flourishing  organization. Sometime in the near  future, a committee will call at your  home or place of business to receive  any articles or materials which you  may wish to donate. These things  will be the medium for the money we  expect by means of the raffles and  auctions.  We do not expect that you will refuse this, hence, in anticipation of the  royal spirit with which you are going  to combine with us to make the Y.M.  H.A. Bazaar an overwhelming success,  we thank you heartily.  The Committee,  Leo A. Meltzer, Chairman.

During the past year it was necessary to move our offices which  were inadequate for our work to a  large space in the same building.  The personnel of our staff was also  somewhat changed. Miss Rae Behr-  man, who occupied the position as  executive social worker for sixteen  months, resigned December 31, 1923,  and Miss Bernice Degginger, secretary for the preceding seven months  has since acted in Miss Behrman's  capacity.  We all regretted the necessity for  Miss Behrman's leaving but I am  pleased to say that she left our office  in a perfectly good condition. The  standard records which she started  were complete and splendidly compiled with a budget, summary and  recommendation on each case. These  records are being capably maintained by our present staff. Miss Degginger has shown capacity for carrying on the work started by her predecessor and I feel we are fortunate  in having her services.  In this connection I want to call  your particular attention to what I  consider   an   outstanding   figure   in  PAST PRESIDENTS  HONORED AT "Y"  Given in honor of Past Presidents  A. Rosenthal, H. Kessler, B. B. Lustig, S. C. Spring and Bros. II. Schock-  en and L. A. Meltzer, one of the most  elaborate affairs ever held in the Y.  M.H.A. was enjoyed by a large audience last Sunday night.  M. A. ltobbins, President of Seattle  I. O. B. B., presented each of the  honored men, with the exception of  H. Schoeken who is not in the city,  with a sterling silver life membership  card. President Dr. H. II. Schwartz  was Toastmastor and delivered an inspiring address on the aims of the Y.  The speakers present were Rabbi  Simon Winograd, U. S. District Attorney Thomas P. Revelle, Judge  Everett Smith, of the Superior Court,  Philip Tworoger, H. A. Horowitz and  several others.  More than 200 members and friends  of the Y. M. H. A. were served at the  Banquet which was the feature of the  evening.  "Y" WILL ENTERTAIN  SERVICE MEN HERE  As has been the custom for many  years, the Y.M.H.A. will entertain all  Jewish soldiers, sailors and marines  from the various forts and camps in  this vicinity during the coming Passover Holiday.  A committee appointed at the last  meet ing to plan arrangements for the  entertainment of the service men consists of Herman A. Kessler, Chairman,  A. Rosenthal, P. Tworoger, B. B.  Lustig, M. A. Robbins, Leo A. Meltzer and Maurice Friedman.  The committee will write to the  Commandants of the garrisons to  secure leave of absence for the Jewish  men in uniform and will provide  meals, lodging and entertainment for  tho boys during the Holiday.

The League now realizes thai  little call lie done with Ihe professional anti-Semite,    lie is unwilling  to lie convinced of his errors.

SAN ANTONIO B.B.  PROTESTS SCHOOL  BIBLE READING  LODGE AND C. O. J. W. OBJECT  TO SCHOOL BOARD ACTION  San Antonio, Tex. (J.T.A.)—The  local B'Nai Brith and the San Antonio ('ouneil of Jewish Women arc  faking steps to protest the action of  the local Board of Education which  passed by unanimous vote a resolution providing for the reading of the  Bible in the public schools. The passing of this resolution was not a surprise, as the mat ter had come up prior  to the school election on February  6th, bit the mat ter was then held in  abatmont as the term of that board  was nearing its end. The question  was made an issue in the eleel ion with  the result thai the ticket opposing the  soripl ure reading was defeated.  The resolution provides for the excusing from class of any pupil, who  upon a statement of his parent, objects to the reading on conscientious  grounds. According to Dr. Samuel L.  Marks, local Rabbi, the Jews are objecting on the ground that even  though attending the lesson is not  compulsory,   the  rights of all   except  Protestants are being violated in that  public money will be used to equip the  seven hundred and fifty classrooms in  the city with the King James version.
